# Examples

This directory contains example SysML v2 models.

## OMG Training Examples

The official OMG SysML v2 training examples are **not included in this repository**.

**Download them with:**

```bash
./scripts/download-training-examples.sh
```

That fetches `sysml/src/training` from the pinned pilot release
(https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation) into
`sysml-v2-training/`, which is gitignored.

**Status:** the corpus gate's current result is in
[docs/project/training-examples.md](../docs/project/training-examples.md), with the files that
still report errors and why.

## Walkthroughs

Each of these is a model and a walkthrough of the commands that exercise it.

| Model | Walkthrough | What it demonstrates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [runtime-showcase/](runtime-showcase/) | [runtime-showcase/README.md](runtime-showcase/README.md) | what only running a model answers: a recursive mass rollup over a materialized launch vehicle, a delta-v budget with units carried through to an analysis verdict, a reliability product asserted of two missions, a mission action branching on its budget and a clocked state machine — each with one well-formed construct that fails at runtime with the reason named — a spacecraft downlink whose ground station and spacecraft run on one clock through an interface, with orthogonal regions, timed do actions and a schedule choice, and the same failures found in the published Apollo 11 model |
| [disposal-robot-demo/robot.sysml](disposal-robot-demo/robot.sysml) | [disposal-robot-demo/README.md](disposal-robot-demo/README.md) | one bomb-disposal robot, end to end: structure, calculations, an action with a fork/join, a branch and a nested flow, a hierarchical state machine an object exhibits, assignment through a feature chain, the solver commands, the view renderings, and [the same questions from Python](disposal-robot-demo/robot_demo.py) |
| [disposal-team-demo/team.sysml](disposal-team-demo/team.sysml) | [disposal-team-demo/README.md](disposal-team-demo/README.md) | the team around that robot, written for what the robot demo does not reach: quantities with units, `select` and `reduce` over a fleet, a message crossing the connector two parts are joined by, an occurrence with a snapshot and a timeslice, and a requirement, use case, verification case and analysis case over the same subject |
| [relay-probe-demo/mission.sysml](relay-probe-demo/mission.sysml) | [relay-probe-demo/README.md](relay-probe-demo/README.md) | one individual probe across its mission phases: event occurrences ordered in time, snapshots and a timeslice of one individual, occurrences with multiplicity, a calculation reading across two snapshots, a requirement whose subject is a snapshot, and a beacon inside a timeslice sending telemetry through its probe's own port |
| [analysis-demo/lander.sysml](analysis-demo/lander.sysml) | [analysis-demo/README.md](analysis-demo/README.md) | analysis cases, asked every way the tool answers them: an analysis whose action steps feed each other and whose objective is a requirement, run bound, with arguments and on an object; a verification case whose body decides its verdict beside its objective; a parameter sweep and a seeded sample; two trade studies choosing among three landers; an action and a state machine due at the same instant of one clock, under each scheduling policy and explored; `-trace`, `-json`, the REPL forms and [the same questions from Python](analysis-demo/lander_demo.py) |
| [verdicts-demo/rover.sysml](verdicts-demo/rover.sysml) | [verdicts-demo/README.md](verdicts-demo/README.md) | `Verdicts(...)` in a document query: one row per assertion about a rover and every object it holds — its constraints, a requirement it carries, a `satisfy` of its battery with the verification case verifying it, six wheels from a multiplicity and a heater no value decides — over the declared object, then over the object a session holds after a drive; what the table sees that evaluating one expression does not |
| [analysis-results-demo/lander-results.sysml](analysis-results-demo/lander-results.sysml) | [analysis-results-demo/README.md](analysis-results-demo/README.md) | saving analysis runs into the model: `-analysis` and `-sweep` print and discard, so each run is written back as a `part` usage typed by a result-record definition with `@RecordedRun` provenance metadata and a `ref part` to its subject — then a document groups the records by subject, filters the sweep rows and the trade study, lists every annotated record's command, and flags the record a later model edit made stale, beside live `Verdicts` recomputed at render time |
| [external-tool-demo/thermal.sysml](external-tool-demo/thermal.sysml) | [external-tool-demo/README.md](external-tool-demo/README.md) | an analysis action performed by a program outside the tool: a Python solver registered through `OPENSYSML_TOOLS` with an `invocation`/`reply` manifest block, previewed by `-tool-dry-run` without starting it, run by `-analysis`, recorded by `-record-run` with every tool call named in `RecordedRun.tools`, and tabulated by a rendered document |
| [solver-demo.sysml](solver-demo.sysml) | [SOLVER-DEMO.md](SOLVER-DEMO.md) | `%check`, `%explain`, `%solve`, `%configure` and `%optimize` — what conditions *can* hold, which conflict, what satisfies them, which variants are permitted, what is best (needs z3 or cvc5) |
| [oosem-demo/oosem-demo.sysml](oosem-demo/oosem-demo.sysml) | [oosem-demo/README.md](oosem-demo/README.md) | the `OOSEM` library on a small Earth-observation mission: as-is and to-be enterprise, causal analysis, stakeholder needs derived down to component requirements with `#moe`/`#mop`, the black-box system context and its use case, the logical scenario and components, and the physical architecture distributed over nodes |
| [mosa-demo/mosa-demo.sysml](mosa-demo/mosa-demo.sysml) | [mosa-demo/README.md](mosa-demo/README.md) | the `MOSA` library on a modular ground vehicle: the major system platform, its major system components and a modular autonomy system, the modular system interfaces between them (one written as `#keyInterface`), the consensus standards they conform to, data rights and proprietary elements, interface control, MOSA requirements with their traces, a conformance assessment, the MOSA views and a generated interface control document; `-validate` reports the openness gaps the model leaves on purpose |
| [views-demo.sysml](views-demo.sysml) | [VIEWS-DEMO.md](VIEWS-DEMO.md) | `%view` and `%render` — the five rendering kinds, the text/Mermaid/Markdown forms, viewpoint conformance and filtered exposure |
| [expressions-demo.sysml](expressions-demo.sysml) | [EXPRESSIONS-DEMO.md](EXPRESSIONS-DEMO.md) | the expression forms worked through one payload: `as` casts that select rather than convert, `*` as the unbounded value, `.metadata` on an annotated part, calculations passed and invoked as function values, a `Set` with no order and no repeats, a rank-three tensor quantity indexed and scaled, and `collect`/`select`/`reduce` bodies typed by what they return |
| [action-executor-demo.sysml](action-executor-demo.sysml) | [ACTION-EXECUTOR-DEMO.md](ACTION-EXECUTOR-DEMO.md) | executing actions, and stepping one in the REPL |
| [self-model/](self-model/) | [self-model/README.md](self-model/README.md) | OpenSysML's own architecture in SysML v2: the analysis pipeline as parts, ports and item flows onto the Go packages that implement it, the validation tiers and the two execution engines as state machines, the [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) architecture invariants as requirements the tool evaluates, and the views `make self-model` renders the architecture diagrams from |
| `parser_features_demo_*.sysml`/`.kerml` | [PARSER_FEATURES_DEMOS.md](PARSER_FEATURES_DEMOS.md) | the notation the parser accepts, feature by feature |

## Other Examples

[SysML-LoRD](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/SysML-LoRD) models *Legend of the Red Dragon*, the
BBS door game, as a system — every mechanic an executable SysML action or transition — and
plays it in the browser at <https://lord.opensysml.org/>: a program on the public Go API
(`client/opensysml`), compiled to WebAssembly, that depends on this repository as a module.

Additional example models may be added to this directory. SysML v2 files use the `.sysml`
extension and KerML files use `.kerml`.
