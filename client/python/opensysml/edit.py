"""Changing a loaded model and writing it back, with its layout intact.

An edit is described, not typed out: an :class:`Editor` collects operations
naming elements the way a read result names them, and :meth:`Editor.apply` has
the service perform them on the source it parsed. The service edits the bytes the
operations reach and nothing else, so comments, blank lines and indentation
outside an edited span come back unchanged, and it re-parses what it edited
before returning it.

Operations include setting a feature's value, renaming a declaration, adding a
member, connection or transition, deleting a declaration, and moving one into
another namespace.
Renaming rewrites the declaration's name token only and is refused for an
element that is referenced — see :class:`~opensysml.errors.RenameReferencedError`.
