"""What a connected sysml-grpc service can do, and how a client requires it.

The service is released separately from this client, so a client that needs a
feature must ask for it rather than infer it. It asks by *capability name*, not
by version: version strings of forks and development builds are not ordered
against each other (a source build reports ``dev``), while a capability name is
an exact contract the service either reports or does not.

A service too old to answer ``GetServerInfo`` fails the call with
``UNIMPLEMENTED``, which is itself an answer — :data:`ServerInfo.answered` is
then ``False``, and no capability is claimed.
