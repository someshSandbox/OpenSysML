# Bring your own engine: external engines, strategies and the trust they earn

A design for letting a user add to the [analysis framework](analysis-framework.md) without
changing OpenSysML: an **engine** of their own that answers questions about a model (a model
checker, a simulator, a statistical analyzer), a **strategy** of their own inside an existing
engine (a scheduling policy, a sampler), or a **tool** of their own that computes an action's
outputs — as a process speaking a documented protocol, as a WebAssembly module, or as Go
compiled into a binary they build. Nothing here is implemented. The note fixes the manifest that
registers them, the protocol they speak, the standing their answers are given and how they earn
more, and the surfaces that show them, so the work can be reviewed before code is written.

The framework note leaves this open in one sentence — *a WebAssembly or gRPC engine host is
compatible with the contract and left to a later note* — and designs one of the three kinds in
full: the tool manifest and the `tool:<name>` engine. This note generalizes that design to
engines and strategies, keeps every rule the framework fixed (the strength scale, the replay
gate, the referee, dispatch, determinism under `-jobs`), and adds the one thing external code
needs that built-in code does not: a rule for how much its word is worth.

## The problem this answers

The framework as designed admits three ways to add an engine, and two of them are closed to a
user:

| Way in | Who can use it | Cost |
|--------|----------------|------|
| A Go type implementing `Engine`, registered into `Default()` | a contributor to this repository | a pull request; the contract lives under `internal/` and cannot be imported |
| An executable in the tool manifest (`OPENSYSML_TOOLS`) | anyone with a binary | none — but it answers only `compute`: one invocation, inputs in, outputs out, *observed* |
| A Go `plugin` | nobody | rejected by the framework note: platform-limited, toolchain-locked, an ABI to protect |

So a site that owns a model checker for its own formalism, a simulator with a licence, a
scheduling heuristic that reproduces its fielded dispatcher, or a sampler tuned to its parameter
space, cannot bring it to a model without forking the binary. Three needs the tool protocol does
not meet:

- **An engine answers a question, not an action.** `holds`, `outcomes`, `sensitive` and
  `satisfiable` take a subject, bindings, free variables and bounds, run for a long time, need
  to be cancelled, and return a claim with a strength and a witness. `compute` takes inputs and
  returns outputs.
- **A strategy is consulted many times inside one run.** A scheduling policy is asked at every
  choice point which enabled token moves; a sampler is asked once per sweep for its rows. One
  process invocation per question is the wrong grain.
- **An external answer needs a standing.** A tool's is *observed* because nothing in OpenSysML
  knows what it should have computed. An external model checker's `unsat` is a claim of proof
  the framework can neither verify nor, without a rule, refuse — and the strength scale exists
  so that no result is printed stronger than it was earned.

## What exists to build on

- **The framework's engine contract**, unchanged: `Engine` with `Describe`, `Covers` and `Run`;
  `Result` with `Claim`, `Strength`, `Bounds`, `Witness`, `Reason`; the registry that refuses a
  duplicate name; dispatch by `auto`, an explicit name, or `all`. An external engine is one more
  `Engine` the coordinator sees; the adapter that speaks to the process is the whole addition.
- **The tool manifest and protocol.** One entry per executable in a directory the environment
  names, one JSON object in on standard input, one out on standard output, every failure a typed
  error, no value invented. The engine protocol is this protocol with a session and more
  message kinds.
- **The framework already trusts external processes, by declaration and probe.** `solve`
  reports *proved* on z3's `unsat`; `solve.DeclaredCapabilities` states what a known backend
  supports without running it and `Capabilities.Probed` records when the answers came from
  running it instead; a capability the backend refused stops a query before it is sent. The
  manifest declares, the handshake probes, and a mismatch refuses — the same shape.
- **The replay policy and the evaluator's confirmation.** The [SMT
  design](smt-model-checking.md)'s `-schedule replay:<file>` follows a witness move for move and
  refuses a move that is not enabled, naming it; the framework has `solve` confirm a `sat` model
  by evaluating the conditions at the assignment. Between them they check every kind of witness
  an external engine can return, and the replay file is the format every external schedule is
  written in.
- **`-engine all` as referee.** The framework runs every covering engine and turns a
  contradiction with `explore` into a disagreement in the interpreter's favor. Run over a corpus
  of models with known outcomes, that is a harness that measures an external engine.
- **Framed messages on standard input.** `cmd/sysml-lsp` speaks the Language Server Protocol
  over standard input and output, and `internal/frontend/stdiorpc` serves the gRPC service the same way.
  A long-lived process on a pair of pipes is a transport this repository already runs and
  tests.
- **The public Go API.** `client/opensysml` is the one package with a compatibility
  commitment, answered in process by the engine the importing binary links. It is where a Go
  engine's contract is exposed, because it is the only place a Go program outside this
  repository may import.

## Three kinds of contribution

| Kind | Manifest `kind` | Answers | Consulted | Standing of its answers |
|------|-----------------|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **tool** | `tool` | `compute` for an action annotated `ToolExecution` | once per performance | *observed*, as the framework fixes |
| **engine** | `engine` | any of `evaluate`, `outcomes`, `holds`, `sensitive`, `satisfiable`, `sweep`, as it declares | once per question, in a session that lives for the plan | existential claims *witnessed* after replay, else *not covered*; universal claims *observed* when the executions they rest on replay, at a strength the site **admits** against a referee record, and otherwise *not covered* with the claim kept |
| **strategy** | `policy`, `sampler` | a slot inside a built-in engine: which enabled token moves, which rows a sweep runs | many times per run, in a session that lives for the run | none of its own — a run under an external policy is a fixed-policy run, *observed*, as under `reverse` |

A fourth kind is not an engine at all and is named only to exclude it: a **rule written in the
model** — a `DocumentQueries` query or a viewpoint concern whose rows are diagnostics. That is a
future built-in engine over the query layer, listed as such in the framework note, and needs no
manifest because the model carries it.

## The manifest

The framework's tool manifest generalizes to one **manifest entry format** read from two
directories: `OPENSYSML_TOOLS`, whose meaning does not change, and `OPENSYSML_ENGINES`, which
holds engines and strategies. Either may hold any kind; the two names exist so that a site can
keep the executables its models name apart from the engines its analysts choose. Each entry is
one JSON file, named for the engine:

```json
{
  "kind": "engine",
  "name": "spin-bridge",
  "version": "1.4.0",
  "command": ["/opt/spin-bridge/bin/spin-bridge", "--serve"],
  "transport": "stdio",
  "protocol": 1,
  "answers": ["holds", "outcomes"],
  "subjects": ["action"],
  "model": ["sources", "graphs:1"],
  "bounds": ["depth", "steps", "runs"],
  "witness": "schedule",
  "authority": "bounded"
}
```

The fields are the framework's `Description`, written down so that **listing engines spawns no
process**: `sysml -engines` reads the manifests and prints each entry with its source
(`spin-bridge 1.4.0: engine from /etc/opensysml/engines/spin-bridge.json, runs
/opt/spin-bridge/bin/spin-bridge, not admitted`), and the process runs only when a question
reaches it. The listing states what can be known from the file: that it parses, that its
`protocol` is served, that its `command` resolves to an existing executable inside the rules
below, that its name is unique. What only the process can tell — whether it starts, and whether
its own description agrees with the manifest — is verified on the first `describe` of a session
(below) and reported in the plan that needed it; `sysml -engines -probe` is the one listing that
spawns, running `describe` against every entry and printing the outcome, so an operator can
check an installation without asking a question. An engine whose own description disagrees
with its manifest — a different name, version, protocol or a smaller set of questions — is
refused with a typed error naming the field, never quietly trusted for what it said or for what
the manifest said.

- `command` is the executable and its arguments. The executable is an absolute path or a path
  relative to the manifest's directory; a relative path is joined to that directory, resolved
  through every symbolic link, and refused unless the result is inside the directory — so
  neither `..` nor a link placed there can name a program elsewhere. `-engines` prints the
  resolved path. `transport` is `stdio` (a child process on a pair of pipes) or `grpc`, in which
  case `address` replaces `command` and the same messages travel as one bidirectional streaming
  RPC; the first stage implements `stdio` and defines `grpc`, since the messages are identical
  and the first external engines are local executables.
- `protocol` is the version of the message set the engine speaks; the host lists the versions
  it serves and refuses an entry outside them.
- `answers`, `subjects`, `bounds` and `witness` (`schedule`, `assignment` or `none`) are the
  framework's `Description`, and `Covers` refuses a question outside them before the process is
  asked.
- `model` names the forms of the model the engine reads (below); `graphs:1` is the lowered-graph
  export at version 1.
- `authority` is the strongest strength the engine says it can produce for a universal claim;
  `admit`, absent by default and `bounded` or `proved` when present, is the strongest the site
  allows such a claim to be composed at, and is the subject of the standing section. An entry
  with no `admit` has its universal claims composed as *not covered* unless they rest on
  executions the interpreter replays.
- `concurrent`, default true, says whether one process may hold several `run` requests open at
  once — the questions `-jobs` puts to the engine at the same time. An engine that cannot gets
  one process per open request: the coordinator starts another session for the next question
  while one is still answering, and ends it with the plan. The unit is the request, never
  anything inside it: what an engine does to answer one `run` — the solver queries, the
  simulations, the rows of a `sweep` it was asked whole — is its own, and the host neither
  sees nor splits it.

A strategy's entry is the same file with `kind` `policy` or `sampler`, a `protocol`, and no
question fields:

```json
{ "kind": "policy", "name": "priority", "version": "0.3", "command": ["./priority-policy"], "protocol": 1 }
```

Two rules the manifest enforces that the tool manifest already implied:

- **Manifests come from the environment, never from a workspace or a model.** A model may name
  a `toolName`; it may never name an executable. A manifest directory under a workspace is not
  read, and a `.sysml` file cannot register anything. The LSP and the gRPC service read the
  same directories as the CLI and spawn an external engine only when a request names one, never
  on an edit or a parse.
- **No discovery on `PATH`.** `solve` finds z3 and cvc5 on `PATH` because they are two known
  programs with known dialects; an engine is known only by its manifest. A name that is
  registered by two entries is the framework's duplicate-registration error, reported at
  startup in `-engines`, and neither entry answers.

## The engine protocol

A **session** is one process for one plan. The coordinator starts it at the plan's first
question to the engine and ends it when the plan ends or the deadline passes, so an engine that
loads a formalism or warms a solver pays once per plan, and under `-jobs` several questions to
one engine share one process, each an open `run` request with its own `id`, unless the entry
declares `"concurrent": false`, in which case the coordinator starts one process per open
request and the engine sees one question at a time. Standard error is captured up to `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT`
(the rest discarded), printed with a *not covered* result's reason, and never parsed.

Messages are JSON-RPC 2.0 objects, one per line — the envelope `internal/frontend/stdiorpc` already
speaks, with the newline in place of its `Content-Length` header. Every message carries
`"jsonrpc": "2.0"`; a request carries an `id` its answer repeats; a notification carries no
`id` and gets no answer. The host sends three requests and one notification:

| Message | Params | Answer |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `describe` (request) | the protocol versions the host serves | the engine's description — verified against the manifest before anything else is sent |
| `covers` (request) | the question, and the model in the forms the entry asked for | `covers: true`, or `covers: false` with `reason` |
| `run` (request) | the question, the model, the `bounds` the question fixes, the `budget` (deadline as an absolute time, `depth`, `steps`, `runs`, `memory`) | the result (below); `progress` notifications may precede it |
| `cancel` (notification) | the `id` of a running `run` | none — as the Language Server Protocol's `$/cancelRequest`; the `run` it names answers with what it has, marked by the bound it reached, and the host waits for that answer until the deadline |

The engine sends the `progress` notification
(`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"progress","params":{"id":3,"runs":120,"depth":17}}`), which the
coordinator prints as it prints `explore`'s progress today, and answers. An answer is
`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"result":{…}}` or
`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"error":{"code":"…","message":"…"}}`, where `code` is `unsupported` (a
construct the engine met at run time and had not refused in `covers`), `budget` (it stopped at a
bound of its own), or `internal`. The JSON Schema the reference publishes covers every message
in both directions, `jsonrpc` member included.

What the host reads is bounded, because the process is not this repository's. One line longer
than `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT` (new, default 64 MiB; it bounds a tool's single answer under
the tool protocol too) is a protocol break: the session ends and the result is *not covered* naming
the size; so is more than that written to standard error, which the process is ended for. A
`witness` is written to disk only after the line that carried it passed that bound, so the
host's disk use per result is bounded by the same number. `progress` notifications are
read as they arrive and coalesced: the coordinator keeps the latest per `run` and prints at the
rate it prints its own progress, so an engine that sends one per state costs the pipe, not the
report. The `memory` budget is passed to the engine as a number to honor and is not enforced by
the host, which has no portable means to bound another process's memory; the site that needs a
hard limit puts one in `command` (`["/usr/bin/prlimit", "--as=…", "/opt/…/spin-bridge"]`,
`systemd-run`, a container), and the reference says so. Time is enforced by the host: at the
deadline it sends `cancel`, waits the grace `OPENSYSML_TOOL_TIMEOUT` allows, then ends the
process and its children.

### What a run carries

The engine cannot read the host's `*Model`, so the request carries the model in the forms the
entry declared, and the question in the model's own names:

- **`sources`**, always: every document of the model as `{path, text}`, and the version of the
  standard library the host embeds. An engine with its own SysML front end reads these and
  nothing else.
- **`graphs:<v>`**: the lowered `ActionGraph` or `StateGraph` of the subject and of every
  behavior it performs, in a versioned JSON form — nodes with their kinds and names, edges with
  guards as expression text, parameters with declared types and units, `HappensBefore` as
  edges, and the footprints once the [explicit-state design](bounded-model-checking.md) lowers
  them. This is a new export of the lowered IR and therefore a new compatibility surface, which
  is why it carries a version and why an engine names the versions it reads; the host serves
  the current version and the one before it, and a change that drops a version is a minor
  release under the rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, as any output-format change is.
- **`rdf`**: the model as the Turtle the RDF export writes, for engines built on graph stores.
- **The question**: its kind; the subject as a qualified name with the `subjects` binding as the
  CLI states it (`Plant::Reactor::regulate reactor`); the condition as a qualified name and as
  expression text; bindings as `{name, value, unit}`; free inputs as `{name, type, unit,
  domain}` with the domain the SMT design derives from the declared type and any assumed
  constraint; and the bounds the question fixes.

### What a result carries

The framework's `Result`, as JSON: `claim` (`holds`, `violated`, `sensitive`, `value`, `table`,
`none`), `strength` as the engine claims it, `bounds` taken and reached, `witness`, `reason`,
`values`, `elapsed`. The two fields the host treats specially:

- **`witness`** is checked by the interpreter before the result is composed, and the check is
  the claim's, not merely the schedule's: a replay that runs to the end proves only that the
  moves are an execution, and the host then evaluates what the claim says of that execution.
  The shape follows the entry's `witness` kind and the claim. A `schedule` witness is a file in
  the `replay:` format the SMT design fixes — the schedule as `step N: <token>@<node> first of …`
  lines naming moves by the labels the lowered-graph export gave them — plus `inputs` as
  `{name, value, unit}`; the host writes it to a file and replays it through `explore`'s replay
  policy, and the SMT design's rule that *a witness that cannot be followed is never silently
  resolved* applies to every external witness without exception. For `violated` the witness
  also names the violating move (`at: <N>`, a step of the schedule, or the schedule's end), and
  the host evaluates the condition at that point of the replay, the state the SMT design's own
  witness reproduces: the witness stands only when the condition evaluates `false` there, so a
  violation that a later move repairs is still a violation, and a schedule that never falsifies
  the condition at the named move is not one. For an outcome the witness stands only when the
  replayed execution's outcome is the one claimed. For `sensitive` the witness is **two**
  schedules under the same `inputs` and the feature they diverge on, the SMT design's two-copy
  shape: the host replays both and the witness stands only when the feature's final values
  differ — one schedule cannot show that another exists. An `assignment` witness, the shape a
  `satisfiable` answer has, is `inputs` alone: the host binds the values to the free features
  and evaluates every condition of the question with the evaluator, as the framework has
  `solve` confirm a `sat` model, and the witness stands only when every condition evaluates
  `true` — a condition that evaluates `false` or that the evaluator cannot evaluate at those
  values is a failed witness. An engine answers a question with the witness kind and count that
  question has: `violated` and an outcome take one schedule, `sensitive` takes two,
  `satisfiable` takes an assignment, and a result that carries the other kind, or one schedule
  for `sensitive`, is a protocol break.
- **`executions`**, optional on a universal claim, is a list of witnesses in the same two
  shapes: the concrete executions the engine ran and found the claim holding on. The host
  replays each and evaluates the claim on it, and they are what lets a universal claim be
  *observed* (next section).
- **`strength`** is what the engine *claims*. What is printed is decided by the next section,
  never by this field alone.

### Failures, classified

The framework distinguishes a fault in the question (an `error` that stops the plan, since no
engine would answer differently) from a reason particular to one engine (*not covered*, which
`auto` advances past). An external engine's failures are all of the second kind:

| Failure | Result |
|---------|--------|
| the process does not start, or `describe` disagrees with the manifest | `Covers` refuses: *not covered: engine 'spin-bridge' at /opt/… did not start (exit 127)*; `-engines -probe` reports the same; plain `-engines`, which spawns nothing, shows only what the file can tell |
| `covers: false` | *not covered* with the engine's reason, in the plan; `auto` advances |
| a line that is not JSON, a missing `jsonrpc` or `id`, a field of the wrong type, an `error` code outside the three, a line or standard error over `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT`, a witness of the wrong kind for the question, a result whose `claim` and `strength` are not a pair the framework admits | *not covered: engine 'spin-bridge' broke protocol: …*, the session ended; `auto` advances |
| the process exits during a `run`, or the deadline passes without an answer to `cancel` | *not covered* with the exit status or the bound; `auto` advances |
| an `error` answer | *not covered* with its `code` and `message` |
| a witness that fails replay or evaluation | *not covered: engine 'spin-bridge' reports a violation; its witness does not replay (move 3, 2@vent is not enabled)*, *… reports a violation at move 5; its schedule replays and `maxPressure` holds there*, *… reports sensitive; both schedules replay and `x` is 1 under each*, or *… reports satisfiable; at its assignment `x > 3` evaluates false* — the framework's rule, never *violated*, *sensitive* or *satisfiable* |
| an existential claim from an entry whose `witness` is `none` | *not covered: engine 'spin-bridge' reports a violation and produces no replayable witness* |
| a universal claim with no `executions` from an entry with no `admit`, or with an `admit` its referee record does not support | *not covered: engine 'spin-bridge' reports holds, bounded at depth 40; not admitted* — the claim kept in the reason and in `Values`, nothing claimed |
| an `executions` entry that fails replay, or on which the claim does not hold | *not covered* naming the execution and the move or the value; the rest are not counted, since the engine's account of what it ran has been shown wrong once |

The one place the rule differs from `solve`'s is deliberate: a built-in engine that returns a
malformed `Result` has broken its own contract and that is an `error`, because it is this
repository's bug; an external engine that does the same is *not covered*, because the plan's
other engines can still answer and the user chose to let this one try. Under `-engine <name>`
the same *not covered* is the result, printed with the reason, as the framework says of every
explicit selection.

## The standing of an external answer

The framework's strength scale is what makes external engines admissible at all: every result
prints how it is supported, so an external answer does not have to be believed or rejected, only
labeled. Three rules decide the label.

**An existential claim is *witnessed* when its witness checks, and *not covered* otherwise.**
This is the framework's rule for `smt`'s `sat` and `solve`'s `sat`, and it needs no trust: the
interpreter is normative, the check is the interpreter's — a schedule replays and the claim is
evaluated at the move it names, two schedules replay and their results are compared, an
assignment is evaluated — and an external model checker whose violation replays and evaluates
`false` there, or an external solver whose assignment satisfies every condition under the
evaluator, has found a real one whatever its own soundness. The witness dominates every
universal claim about the same question, as the framework's first composition rule says.

**A universal claim is *observed* only for executions the interpreter ran, and is otherwise
*not covered* until the site admits it.** There is no replay for a proof. The framework trusts
z3's `unsat` as *proved* because the encoding is this repository's and refereed against
`explore`; a third-party engine's encoding is nobody's here. And *observed* is not a weaker name
for the same claim: the framework defines it as *the claim held on the concrete executions that
were run*, which a symbolic answer has not earned — an external `holds` at claimed strength
*bounded*, printed *observed*, would assert executions that never happened. So an external
universal claim is composed by what it rests on:

- An engine that executes — a simulator, a random tester — returns the executions it ran as
  `executions`, in witness shape. The host replays each and evaluates the claim on it, and the
  result is *observed* over those executions: `holds (observed on 200 executions chosen by
  engine 'sim-bridge', each replayed)`. The observation is the interpreter's; the engine only
  chose which executions to look at, as a scheduling policy does.
- An engine that reasons — a model checker, a solver — has nothing to replay, and its claim is
  composed *not covered*, with what it said kept in the reason and its bounds in `Values`:
  `holds? not covered: engine 'spin-bridge' reports holds, bounded at depth 40; not admitted`.
  Nothing is claimed, `auto` advances, and an analyst who trusts the engine can read what it
  reported. A site that trusts it lifts the claim by setting `admit` in the manifest, and the
  framework honors an `admit` (`bounded` or `proved`) only with a **referee record** beside the
  entry: the composed strength is then `min(claimed, admit)`, printed with the record.

**A referee record is earned on a corpus, by `all`.** `sysml -referee <engine> <dir>` runs
every model under `<dir>` that carries an expected outcome set — the repository's conformance
corpus, or a site's own — under `-engine all` with the external engine beside `explore` (and
`smt` and `check` once they exist), and writes `<name>.referee.json` recording the case set's
hash, the count, how many agreed, every disagreement with its case, and the engine's version. An
`admit` is honored only when a record exists for that version, its case set is the one named,
and every case agreed; the standing line then prints the record —
`holds (bounded at depth 40 by engine 'spin-bridge'; refereed on 412 cases)` — so a reader knows
the strength was admitted, not earned in this repository. A record does not make the engine
sound; it makes the site's decision to trust it visible and revocable. The same run under `all`
outside the harness applies the framework's third rule as it stands: an external `holds` beside
an `explore` witness is a disagreement resolved for the interpreter, and the external result
becomes *not covered* with the disagreement as its reason, whatever the record says.

A record is not a signature, and the design does not pretend it is one. It lives beside the
manifest entry it vouches for, in a directory the environment names, and is worth exactly what
that directory is worth: whoever can write a record there can already write the entry's
`command`, which runs any program as the user — so a forged record grants nothing the directory
did not already grant, and a site protects the two together. Two rules keep that boundary
honest: a record found anywhere but the manifest's own directory is ignored, and an entry or
record whose file, or whose directory, is writable by anyone other than its owner is refused
with a typed error naming the path, the check `ssh` makes of its configuration files. A site
that needs a stronger issuer than file ownership signs the directory's contents with what it
already uses for the executables in it — a package manager, a read-only image — and the
reference says so.

Three consequences the framework's composition rules already carry, stated for external
engines:

- `auto` orders engines by *admitted* authority, and at equal authority a built-in engine
  precedes an external one; an unadmitted engine that reasons can only answer *not covered*
  or *witnessed*, so `auto` reaches it only when every built-in engine refused or ran out, and
  only a witness it finds changes the answer. `-engine <name>` selects it directly; `all`
  includes it.
- An external engine never becomes the referee. Replay is through the interpreter, agreement is
  measured against `explore`, and an external engine's result is never the one a built-in
  result is demoted for.
- Two *observed* results that differ are a *witnessed* sensitivity only when both are
  executions of the interpreter (`reverse` gives `x = 1`, `declared` gives `x = 2`). A
  simulator's `x = 2` reaches the host as an execution to replay: if the replay gives `x = 2`,
  that is the interpreter's own second observation and the sensitivity is witnessed; if the
  replay gives `x = 1`, the simulator disagrees with the interpreter and its result is *not
  covered* with the disagreement as its reason; a simulator that offers no execution to replay
  has reported a value nothing here can check, *not covered* with the value kept.

## Strategies

A strategy fills a slot a built-in engine already has and asks nothing of the framework's
strength rules, because the engine it runs inside decides the standing: a run under any fixed
policy is *observed*; a sweep's rows are *observed* each. Two slots are designed here.

**Scheduling policy** — `-schedule policy:<name>`, `%schedule policy:<name>`, and the same
value in the `schedule` request field, beside `reverse`, `declared`, `seed:<n>` and `explore`.
The `scheduler` in `internal/exec/runtime` resolves every choice point of a run through one
seam, and the external policy is one more resolution: at each choice point the host sends
`choose` with the step, the tokens able to act with their trace labels (`2@heat, 3@vent`) and
whether each is parked or held, and the policy answers with the index it moves; for a due-time
tie (`pickDue`) the same message with the due tokens. The choice is recorded in the trace as
every policy's choices are, so the run replays under `replay:` without the policy present, and a
witness from such a run is a witness like any other. A policy that answers an index out of range,
or does not answer within `OPENSYSML_TOOL_TIMEOUT`, fails the run with a typed error naming the
step, as a bad `seed:` value is refused today. `explore`, `check` and `smt` do not consult it:
they enumerate every choice, and a policy chooses one.

The cost is one round trip per choice point over the session's pipes, which the framework's
measurement of a plan (`plan: …`) reports as the policy's share of the run, so the trade is
visible; a policy that is too slow for a long run is the case the WebAssembly host below is
for.

**Sampler** — `-sampler <name>` beside `-samples <n> -seed <s>`, and `%sampler`. The host sends
`sample` once per sweep with the ranges (`{parameter, type, unit, from, to}`), `n` and the
seed, and the sampler answers with the rows. Rows are validated against the ranges as
`-samples`'s own are — a value outside its range or of the wrong type is a typed error naming
the row — and the table is built and reported as any sweep's is.

Determinism is a property of the interpreter's own policies (`seed:<n>` draws the same values
on every platform) that an external strategy may or may not have. It is tested, not assumed:
`-referee <policy> <dir>` runs the policy twice on every model under `<dir>` and records in its
referee record whether it chose alike, and a run report cites the record —
`policy:priority (external; deterministic on 40 of 40 runs)`, `(external; chose differently on
3 of 40 runs)`, or `(external; not refereed)` when there is none. A non-deterministic policy is
not an error — the trace still replays — but a reader should know the run is one draw.

Slots deliberately not opened here: a reduction heuristic for `check` (its soundness argument
is the design's, and an external persistent-set function could break it invisibly — if wanted,
it is admitted only in the unreduced-comparison mode the explicit-state design already has), an
encoding fragment for `smt` (the encoding is one semantics and stays in one place), and a solver
backend for `solve` (`OPENSYSML_SMT` already names any SMT-LIB2 process, which is that
engine's strategy slot).

## In-process Go

A Go program that already links OpenSysML through `client/opensysml` should be able to add an
engine without a process. The public package gains the framework's contract types — `Engine`,
`Question`, `Result`, `Strength`, `Budget`, `Coverage`, `Description` — and one option:

```go
client, err := opensysml.New(opensysml.WithEngine(myEngine))
```

The engine receives the model through the same public handle the client's other operations use
(parse, lookup, evaluate, the lowered-graph export as Go values rather than JSON), not through
`internal/`, so the compatibility commitment the package already makes covers it. A Go engine
registers with the same `Description` a manifest declares and is listed by `%engines` and
`ListEngines` as `in-process`; its standing is decided by the same rules — its witnesses and
executions replay, and a universal claim that rests on neither is *not covered* unless the
program admits it with `WithEngineAdmit(name, strength, record)`, the record and the admission
being the program's to supply as the manifest's are the site's. The `sysml` binary itself does not load
Go engines; a site that wants one in the CLI builds a `main` of a few lines over the public
package, which the reference documents.

This is the one place the contract's Go shape becomes public API, and the reason to do it late:
the framework's first stages will move the types, and a public package must not.

## WebAssembly

For a strategy consulted at every choice point, or an engine a site wants to distribute without
a build per platform, a **WebAssembly module** is the in-process form of the same protocol: the
manifest entry has `"module": "priority.wasm"` in place of `command`, the host instantiates it
once per session in a runtime implemented in Go without cgo (so `sysml` stays a single static
binary on every platform it ships to), and the messages are the same JSON, passed as bytes
through one exported function `handle(ptr, len) (ptr, len)`. The module has no file system, no
network and no clock beyond the deadline the host passes, which is stricter than a process and
is the point: a policy or sampler needs none of them, and an engine that does is a process. An
engine author writes the message handling once and links it into a module or a program.

The host is the last stage, because it adds a dependency and a runtime to audit, and because
nothing in the protocol depends on it: every engine and strategy above runs as a process first.

## Tools: composed invocations and structured replies

The `tool:<name>` engine runs a program the framework note designed for: the executable is
started with no arguments, one JSON object goes to its standard input, one comes back on its
standard output. That is the right protocol for a program written for OpenSysML and the wrong
one for every program that was not. A solver that takes its inputs as `--mass 12.5`, a script
that reads a CSV and writes a CSV, a legacy binary whose only report is a `T_max = 341.2` line
and an exit code — each today needs a wrapper written per tool, per site, that does the
conversion the manifest could describe. This section adds two optional blocks to the tool entry
so that the manifest describes them: `invocation`, which composes the command line, the
environment, the working directory, the standard input and an input file from the values the
model binds; and `reply`, which reads the outputs back from JSON, CSV, key–value lines, or the
exit status, on standard output or in a file the tool wrote. With both absent the entry means
exactly what it means today, byte for byte.

### What exists, and what stays

The types this section extends are these, and each keeps its meaning:

- `analysis.ToolEntry` (`manifest.go`) is the entry as read: `Kind`, `ToolName`, `Version`,
  `Executable`, `Variables`, and `File`, the path it came from. `ReadManifest` refuses a
  directory under a workspace, a file or directory writable by group or others, an unknown key
  (`json.Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields`), a trailing JSON value, and a relative `executable`
  with a directory part that `confinedPath` cannot keep inside the manifest directory. Every one
  of those rules holds for the two new blocks; a v1 entry parses as before, and a v2 entry is a
  v1 entry plus two optional members.
- `analysis.ToolRequestOf(call)` renders a `runtime.ToolCall` as the request object —
  `toolName`, `uri`, and `inputs` keyed by tool variable, each `{"value": …, "unit": …}` with an
  Integer as a JSON integer, a finite Real as a JSON number, a Boolean as `true`/`false`, a
  String as a JSON string and a quantity's unit by its short name, unconverted. It stays the
  body of `stdin: "json"` and of a JSON `inputFile`, and it stays the **identity of an
  invocation** for divergence: two performances whose `ToolRequestOf` bytes are equal must
  answer equal outputs whatever the invocation wrote on the command line, since the command line
  is a function of those same bytes.
- `analysis.ToolReplyOf(tool, stdout)` parses the reply of today's protocol — `outputs` or
  `error`, a key repeated at any depth malformed, a `null` malformed, a member the shape does not
  name malformed — into a `map[string]runtime.ToolValue` keyed by tool variable. It becomes the
  reader of `format: "object"`, the default, and is not otherwise touched: the pilot's
  `AnalysisAnnotation` fixture and `toolstandin` continue to pass against it unchanged.
- `runtime.ToolValue` is a scalar as the tool wrote it: `Value semantics.Value`, `Text string`
  for a String, `Unit string`. It gains `Items []ToolValue` for a sequence (below) and nothing
  else.
- `runtime.ToolCall.Bind(outputs)` is the one place a reply becomes model values: it refuses an
  output no `out`/`inout` parameter receives (`ToolUnknownOutput`), one the action declares that
  the reply lacks (`ToolMissingOutput`), converts a unit to the coherent unit of the parameter's
  declared kind, refuses a unit on a parameter that admits none and a value the declared type
  cannot hold (`ToolMalformed`), and hands the frame values keyed by parameter name. Every
  format below ends in `Bind`; no format has a binding rule of its own.
- `runtime.performByTool` reads `AnalysisTooling::ToolExecution`, builds the `ToolCall`, needs a
  registered `ToolRunner`, binds what comes back into the action's frame, records divergence,
  and completes the action **without running its body**. A tool failure is the failure of the
  performance. Nothing here adds a fallback to the body or a default value.
- `process.go` bounds the process: `OPENSYSML_TOOL_TIMEOUT` (default 10 s) through the context,
  `WaitDelay` one second so a process that ignores the deadline is killed, `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT`
  (default 64 MiB) on standard output and on the captured standard error. The same three bound
  every invocation below, and the file a `reply` reads.

The model's side does not change at all: `ToolExecution` names a `toolName` and a `uri`,
`ToolVariable` renames parameters, and neither says anything about how the program is called or
how its answer is read. **Composition and parsing are manifest-only.** A model that could set an
argument template would be a model that chooses what runs, which the framework note forbids and
the security section repeats; a model that could set a parser would be a model that chooses
what a number means. Both belong to the site that installed the tool.

### The entry, version 2

```json
{
  "toolName": "ThermalSolver",
  "version": "2.3",
  "executable": "python3",
  "variables": ["mass", "power", "Tmax", "Tprofile"],
  "invocation": {
    "args": ["/opt/thermal/solve.py", "--mass", "{mass}", "--power", "{power.value}",
             "--unit", "{power.unit}", "--out", "{outputDir}/result.csv"],
    "env": {"OMP_NUM_THREADS": "4"},
    "cwd": "/opt/thermal",
    "stdin": "none"
  },
  "reply": {
    "format": "csv",
    "source": "file:{outputDir}/result.csv",
    "header": true,
    "outputs": {
      "Tmax": {"column": "T_max", "row": "last", "unit": "K"},
      "Tprofile": {"column": "T", "row": "all", "unit": "K"}
    }
  }
}
```

There is no `schemaVersion` member: an entry is v2 when it has an `invocation` or a `reply`, and
the fields below are the whole difference. Every rule that follows is checked when the manifest
is read, so a fault registers nothing and `-engines` names it; the only checks left to run time
are those that need the values of one performance (a placeholder for an input the action did not
send, a reply that does not parse).

### `invocation`

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `args` | array of template strings | `[]` | The arguments after the executable, one template per argument |
| `env` | object of string → template string | `{}` | Variables set in the child's environment over the base environment |
| `cwd` | string | inherited | Working directory: absolute, or relative to the manifest's directory and confined to it |
| `stdin` | `"json"` \| `"none"` \| `"csv"` \| `{"template": "…"}` | `"json"` | What the child reads on standard input |
| `inputFile` | `"json"` \| `"csv"` \| `{"template": "…"}` | absent | What `{inputFile}` names; the file is written before the process starts |

- **`args`.** After substitution each element is **one** `argv` entry, passed as
  `exec.CommandContext(ctx, path, args...)` passes it. An element is never split on whitespace,
  never quoted, never joined; `"--mass {mass}"` is one argument containing a space, and the
  example writes `"--mass", "{mass}"` for two. There is no shell at any point: no `sh -c`, no
  `cmd /c`, no glob, no `$VAR`, no `~`. A value containing a space, a quote, a `;` or a
  newline reaches the tool as those bytes in one argument, which is why a String input is safe to
  pass. The executable itself is `executable`, resolved exactly as today, and is never a
  template.
- **`env`.** With `invocation` present the child's environment is the **minimal base** plus the
  passthrough allow-list plus `env`, in that order, later entries winning. The base is `PATH`,
  `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL` and `TZ` copied from the parent when set; on Windows also
  `SystemRoot`, `SystemDrive`, `USERPROFILE`, `TEMP`, `TMP`, `PATHEXT` and `COMSPEC`, since a
  process there does not start without them. `OPENSYSML_TOOL_ENV_PASSTHROUGH`, a comma-separated
  list of names, copies those from the parent when set — the operator's escape for a site whose
  tool needs a license server variable — and a name in it that is unset in the parent is not
  set in the child. `env` values are templates with the same placeholders as `args`. Nothing
  else is inherited: not `OPENSYSML_*`, not the user's shell environment. An entry **without**
  `invocation` inherits the whole parent environment, as today, so a v1 entry sees no change.
- **`cwd`.** An absolute path is used as written; a relative one is joined to the manifest's
  directory, followed through its links with `confinedPath` and refused unless it stays inside,
  exactly as a relative `executable` is. It is not a template. Absent, the child inherits the
  parent's working directory, as today. The directory must exist when the manifest is read;
  it is not created.
- **`stdin`.** `"json"` writes the request object `ToolRequestOf` renders, as today; `"none"`
  closes standard input (the child reads end-of-file at once); `"csv"` writes two RFC 4180
  records — a header of the sent tool variables in `variables` order, then their values as
  `{var}` renders them — with the `,` delimiter, unconverted units not carried (a tool that
  needs them takes `{var.unit}` on the command line); `{"template": "…"}` writes the
  template rendered with the placeholders below, and nothing appended.
- **`inputFile`.** The same three shapes, written to a file in the invocation's temporary
  directory before the process starts, mode `0600`; `{inputFile}` renders its absolute path.
  An entry that names `{inputFile}` without `inputFile` is refused when read, and one that
  declares `inputFile` and never names `{inputFile}` is refused too: a file nothing reads is a
  mistake.

**Placeholders.** A template is a string in which `{…}` is substituted:

| Placeholder | Renders |
|-------------|---------|
| `{var}` | the value of the input the tool variable `var` names, as text, without its unit |
| `{var.value}` | the same as `{var}`; provided so a template reads as a pair beside `{var.unit}` |
| `{var.unit}` | the input's unit by its short name, unconverted, as the JSON protocol sends it (`kg`, `km/h`); the empty string for an input with no unit |
| `{toolName}` | the `ToolExecution`'s `toolName`, as `ToolRequestOf` sends it |
| `{uri}` | the `ToolExecution`'s `uri`, uninterpreted |
| `{inputFile}` | the absolute path of the input file, when `inputFile` is declared |
| `{outputDir}` | the absolute path of the invocation's fresh, empty output directory |

The grammar: `{` name [`.value` | `.unit`] `}`, where name is one of `variables` or one of the
four reserved words `toolName`, `uri`, `inputFile`, `outputDir`. A literal brace is doubled:
`{{` renders `{` and `}}` renders `}`, so `"{{\"n\": {mass}}}"` renders `{"n": 12.5}`. A `{`
that does not open a well-formed placeholder, a `}` that closes none, a name that is neither a
declared variable nor a reserved word, `.value`/`.unit` on a reserved word, and a variable whose
name contains `{`, `}`, `.` or whitespace (such a variable is still sent under `stdin: "json"`,
it just cannot be named in a template) are each a manifest error naming the template and the
offset. A `variables` entry that spells a reserved word is refused, so a template is never
ambiguous. Substitution is a single left-to-right pass over the template: a rendered value is
never re-scanned, so a String input holding `{outputDir}` renders those fourteen characters.

How a value renders as text, for `{var}`, `{var.value}`, the `csv` standard input and the
`csv` input file:

- an **Integer** as its decimal digits, `-` for negative (`strconv.FormatInt(v, 10)`);
- a **Real** as the shortest decimal that round-trips (`strconv.FormatFloat(v, 'g', -1, 64)`):
  `12.5`, `1e-07`, `3`; the same rendering `ToolRequestOf` uses, so a tool reads the same digits
  from the command line as from JSON;
- a **Boolean** as `true` or `false`;
- a **String** as its characters, unquoted and unescaped, spaces and all — one argument;
- a **quantity** as its magnitude, rendered by its kind above; the unit is `{var.unit}`.

A performance that reaches a template naming an input the action did not send — a `variables`
entry that no `in`/`inout` parameter of this action carries — fails with `ToolUnsentInput`
naming the variable and the template before the process starts; the kind today names an input
holding a value the protocol cannot carry (a sequence, an instance), and a value the template
cannot render is the same fault seen from the other side. A `{inputFile}` or `{outputDir}` template never fails at run time:
both exist before substitution.

**The temporary directory.** Every invocation of a v2 entry gets one fresh directory from
`os.MkdirTemp` under the parent's `TMPDIR`, mode `0700`, named `opensysml-tool-<toolName>-*`;
`{outputDir}` is its `out` subdirectory, created empty, and the input file is beside it. The
directory is removed once the reply is read, whether or not the performance succeeded, so a
failed run leaves nothing behind. `OPENSYSML_TOOL_KEEP=1` keeps it and names it in the run
report and in the detail of every tool error, so an operator can inspect what the tool was
given and what it wrote. A v1 entry creates no directory.

### `reply`

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `format` | `"object"` \| `"json"` \| `"csv"` \| `"lines"` \| `"exitcode"` | `"object"` | How the reply is read |
| `source` | `"stdout"` \| `"file:<template>"` | `"stdout"` | Where it is read from; the template may name `{outputDir}` and nothing else |
| `outputs` | object of tool variable → selector | required unless `format` is `object` | Where each output is found |
| `header` | Boolean | `true` | `csv`: whether the first record names the columns |
| `delimiter` | one-character string | `","` | `csv`: the field separator; `"\t"` for tab-separated |
| `regex` | string | absent | `lines`: an RE2 expression whose named groups are outputs |
| `success` | array of integers | `[0]` | `exitcode`: the exit statuses that render `true` |
| `errorPath` | JSON Pointer | absent | `json`: where the tool's own refusal message is |
| `errorColumn` | column name or index | absent | `csv`: the same, in a column |
| `errorKey` | string | absent | `lines`: the same, under a key |

Each member of `outputs` is a selector whose fields depend on the format:

| Field | Formats | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| `path` | `json` | required | RFC 6901 JSON Pointer to the value (`/results/0/Tmax`) |
| `column` | `csv` | required | column name (with `header`) or zero-based index (an integer) |
| `row` | `csv` | `"last"` | `"first"`, `"last"`, a zero-based integer, or `"all"` |
| `key` | `lines` | the tool variable's name | the key on the left of `=` or `:` |
| `type` | all but `object` | `"number"` | `"number"`, `"integer"`, `"real"`, `"boolean"` or `"string"`: what the text is read as |
| `unit` | all but `object`, `exitcode` | absent | the unit of the value, fixed by the manifest, by its short name (`K`, `m/s`) |
| `unitPath` | `json` | absent | a pointer to a string holding the unit |
| `unitColumn` | `csv` | absent | a column holding the unit, read from the same row(s) |

`unit` and `unitPath`/`unitColumn` are exclusive; a unit read from the reply that is not a
unit the library knows is `ToolMalformed`. The unit found either way is placed in
`ToolValue.Unit`, and `Bind` converts it exactly as it converts the JSON protocol's `unit`
today: to the coherent unit of the parameter's declared kind, refused on a parameter that admits
none. A `reply.outputs` key that is not in `variables` is a manifest error. `format: "object"`
admits no other member of `reply` and no `outputs`: the protocol is the whole description.

**Where it comes from.** `"stdout"` is the standard output, bounded as today. `"file:…"` is a
path rendered from the template with `{outputDir}` — the only placeholder `source` admits, since
a file the tool wrote is by construction in the directory made for it — then `filepath.Clean`ed
and refused unless it is under `{outputDir}` and `Lstat` says it is a regular file (not a link,
not a directory). A file the tool did not write is `ToolMalformed` (*tool 'ThermalSolver' wrote
no file result.csv*); one over `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT` is malformed as an oversize standard
output is. With a file source the standard output is still captured and bounded, and quoted in
the detail of a failure, but not parsed. The exit status is checked **before** the source is
read for every format but `exitcode`: a non-zero exit is `ToolProcessFailed` with the captured
standard error quoted, as today, and whatever the tool wrote is not read.

**`object`.** `ToolReplyOf`, unchanged, on the standard output; `source: "file:…"` is admitted
so a tool may write the same object to a file.

**`json`.** The source is one JSON value (a trailing value is malformed, as today). Each `path`
is evaluated by RFC 6901 — `~1` is `/`, `~0` is `~`, a digit token indexes an array — and must
resolve: a member or index that does not exist is `ToolMissingOutput` naming the variable and
the pointer. A pointer resolving to a number, a string or a Boolean is a scalar `ToolValue`,
typed as the JSON protocol types it and then checked against `type`; a pointer resolving to an
array whose every element is such a scalar is a sequence (below); `null`, an object, and an
array holding an object, an array or `null` are `ToolMalformed`. A duplicate key anywhere in the
document is malformed, as today. `errorPath`, when it resolves to a non-empty string, makes the
performance `ToolRefused` with that message, checked before any output is read; a pointer that
does not resolve, or resolves to the empty string, means the tool did not refuse.

**`csv`.** The source is read by `encoding/csv` with `delimiter`, every record of one width
(a ragged record is `ToolMalformed` naming its number), quoted fields per RFC 4180, a leading
byte-order mark dropped. With `header` the first record names the columns and `column` may be a
name; a name the header lacks is `ToolMalformed`, a name it holds twice is malformed too. Without
`header`, or with an integer `column`, the column is a zero-based index into every record. Rows
are the **data records** — the header is not a row — and `row` selects among them: `"first"`
is data record 0, `"last"` the final one, an integer *n* is the zero-based *n*th (a negative
integer is a manifest error, and *n* past the end is `ToolMalformed` naming the column and *n*),
and `"all"` is every data record in order, as a sequence. A source with no data record makes
`"first"`, `"last"` and any *n* `ToolMissingOutput` and `"all"` the empty sequence. A cell is
trimmed of leading and trailing white space before it is typed, unless `type` is `string`, in
which case it is taken as unquoted. An empty cell after trimming is `ToolMissingOutput` for
that variable and row — no default is invented — unless `type` is `string`. `unitColumn` reads
the unit from the same row as the value, and with `row: "all"` every row's unit must be the
same one. `errorColumn`, when any data record's cell in that column is non-empty, is
`ToolRefused` with the first such cell's text.

**`lines`.** The source is text split on `\n` (a trailing `\r` dropped). Without `regex`, each
non-blank line is `key` `=` *value* or `key` `:` *value*, split at the **first** `=` or `:`, both
sides trimmed; a line with neither separator is ignored, so a tool's chatter around its answers
costs nothing. Each output's `key` (default: the tool variable's name) must appear exactly once:
absent is `ToolMissingOutput`, twice is `ToolMalformed` naming the key and both line numbers.
With `regex`, an RE2 expression compiled when the manifest is read, the expression is matched
against each line, and every **named group** `(?P<Tmax>…)` is an output whose name must be a
tool variable in `outputs` (a group naming no output, or an output no group names, is a
manifest error; `key` is not admitted beside `regex`); a group that matches on two lines is
malformed as a repeated key is, one that matches on none is missing. `errorKey` is a key whose
presence with a non-empty value is `ToolRefused` with that value. There is no sequence form of
`lines`.

**`exitcode`.** `outputs` names exactly one tool variable, `type` `boolean` (default) or
`integer`, and the process's exit status is the reply: `true` when the status is in `success`,
`false` otherwise, or the status itself as an Integer. The status is data, so a non-zero exit
is **not** `ToolProcessFailed` under this format; a process that could not be started, was
killed by a signal or by the deadline is still a process failure or a timeout. No `source`,
`unit`, `errorPath` or sequence.

**`type`.** Text formats need it because every cell is text; `json` admits it as a check. The
default `"number"` reads as the JSON protocol reads a number today: an Integer when the text is
a decimal integer that fits, else a finite Real (`1e3` is Real `1000`; `inf` and `nan` are
malformed). `"integer"` refuses `12.0`; `"real"` reads an integer literal as a Real; `"boolean"`
accepts `true`/`false` case-insensitively and nothing else (`1`/`0` are Integers, and a
`Boolean` parameter refuses them in `Bind`, as today); `"string"` takes the text. Under `json`,
`type` must agree with the JSON kind found (`"string"` refuses a number, `"number"` refuses a
string) — the pointer tells where, `type` tells what, and a disagreement is `ToolMalformed`. What
`Bind` then does with a Real for an `Integer` parameter is unchanged: refused.

**Errors, and how they are named.** Every failure is one of the framework's `ToolError` kinds
and fails the performance; none is *not covered*, none reaches the body. What changes is the
detail:

| Kind | Cause added by this section | Detail names |
|------|------------------------------|--------------|
| `ToolProcessFailed` | unchanged: non-zero exit (every format but `exitcode`), a process that could not start | the exit status and the captured standard error, as today |
| `ToolTimeout` | unchanged | as today |
| `ToolMalformed` | a source that does not parse; a pointer to `null`/object; a ragged or headerless-named CSV; a missing file; oversize output or file; a `type` disagreement; a repeated key, header name or group match; a unit the library lacks; a scalar for a sequence parameter or the reverse; mixed kinds in a sequence | the tool variable, then for `json` the pointer (`Tmax at /results/0/Tmax: string where number expected`), for `csv` the column and the data row (`Tmax in column T_max, row 3: "n/a" is not a number`), for `lines` the key or group and the line number, for a file its path relative to `{outputDir}` |
| `ToolMissingOutput` | a pointer, column/row, key or group with nothing there; an empty CSV cell | the tool variable and where it was looked for |
| `ToolUnknownOutput` | unchanged: an output no parameter of this action receives — the `object` protocol's extra key, or a `reply.outputs` entry the action has no `out` for | the tool variable |
| `ToolRefused` | `error` in the `object` protocol, as today; `errorPath`, `errorColumn` or `errorKey` yielding a non-empty string | the tool's message, verbatim |
| `ToolUnsentInput` | a template naming a variable this action does not send | the variable and the template |

Divergence is unchanged in rule and changes in what it compares: two invocations with equal
`ToolRequestOf` bytes whose parsed replies — the `ToolValue`s **after** the format read them and
before `Bind` converted them, rendered by `renderReply` — differ set the `ToolDivergence` run
note, so a CSV tool that writes `341.20` once and `341.2` next diverges only if the numbers do.

### Sequences

A `row: "all"` and a pointer to an array give a **sequence-valued** output: `ToolValue.Items`
holds the elements in reply order, each a scalar `ToolValue` of one kind — all numbers, all
Booleans or all Strings, mixed kinds malformed — and the outer value carries the `Unit` they
share and no `Value` of its own. `Bind` binds a sequence only to a parameter whose multiplicity
admits more than one (`[0..*]`, `[1..*]`, `[0..n]` with *n* > 1) and a scalar only to one whose
upper bound is 1: a sequence for `attribute Tmax : Real` and a scalar for `Tprofile : Real[0..*]`
are each `ToolMalformed` naming the variable and the multiplicity, since a silent wrap or a
silent first-element would be an invented value. The bound value is the runtime's `ValSequence`
of the converted elements, each converted to the coherent unit as a scalar is, so the model
reads `Tprofile` as it reads any `Real[0..*]`; the multiplicity's bounds are checked as the
runtime checks any write (an empty sequence to `[1..*]` is refused there, not here). Recording
spells a sequence as a list literal: `attribute Tprofile : Real[0..*] ordered nonunique` declared on the run
definition and `attribute :>> Tprofile = (300.0, 310.5, 341.2);` on each record, with the
element type the scalars share and the items in reply order, so a record reads as a model
value and not as a quotation, and a document table cell holds it as it holds any
sequence-valued attribute. `renderReply`
renders `Items` in the same form for divergence. `stdin: "csv"` and `{var}` render inputs only,
and a sequence-valued **input** is out of scope for this note: a `ToolCall.Inputs` element is a
scalar, and an action whose `in` parameter has an upper bound above 1 and a `ToolVariable` is
refused before the process starts, as it is today.

### Tools on calc definitions

`ToolExecution` on a `calc def` or a calc usage makes the tool the calculation: its `in`
parameters are the inputs, its `return` and `out` parameters the outputs, and the body — if the
author wrote one — never evaluates, exactly as an action's body never performs. This is what
lets `attribute Tmax = thermal(mass, power)` reach a program, and with it `calc`, `%calc`,
`EvaluateCalc` and a document formula, since each evaluates the same calc usage. The
implementation puts the `ToolRunner` on the `EvalContext` every evaluation carries rather than
on the analysis plan alone, and `calcUsageRun` consults the annotation where it would otherwise
enter the body. A calc under a tool is *observed* like an action under one, its performance
fails like one, and it diverges like one; a calc evaluated under `smt` is a free output in its
declared domain, which the framework note already says of a tool-computed value. Nothing about
the manifest changes for a calc: the same entry serves an action and a calc that name the same
tool, since the entry describes the program, not the caller.

### Dry run

`sysml -tool-dry-run <case|action|calc>` and `%tool <case|action|calc>` show what a tool would
be given, without giving it. The case is performed with a `ToolRunner` that, at each tool call
reached, prints the resolved manifest file, the resolved executable, each `argv` element on its
own line as Go's `%q` spells it (so a space or a quote inside one is unambiguous), the
environment the child would receive as `NAME=value` lines, the working directory, the standard
input mode and its rendered bytes, the input file's rendered bytes, and the `reply` mapping —
and then fails the performance with a typed `ToolDryRun` the surface swallows, so nothing after
the call runs and no process starts. `{outputDir}` and `{inputFile}` render as
`<outputDir>` and `<inputFile>` since neither directory is made. A case with two tool actions in
sequence shows the first; the second depends on outputs the dry run does not have, and the
report says so.

### Listing and provenance

The `protocol` column of `-engines`, `%engines` and `ListEngines` says what a tool entry
speaks: `object` for today's protocol (unchanged, so goldens hold), `argv` for an `invocation`
with an `object` reply, and `argv+csv`, `argv+json`, `argv+lines`, `argv+exitcode` — or the
format alone when there is no `invocation` — for the rest. `ListEngines` carries the same string
in the `protocol` field it already has; no RPC is added, and the Python client's engine listing
exposes the field it already parses.

A recorded run (`record.Provenance`) today says which `sysml` made it and with what command.
A run that reached a tool gains, per tool call, the tool's `toolName`, its `version` and the
manifest file it came from, and the rendered `argv` (or `stdin` for a v1 entry, as
`ToolRequestOf` rendered it), so a record reads *ThermalSolver 2.3 from
/etc/opensysml/tools/thermal.json: python3 /opt/thermal/solve.py --mass 12.5 …*. This is
recorded in `AnalysisRecords` as a `tools : String[0..*]` attribute of `RecordedRun`, one
element per call in call order, so a record whose model names no tool has an empty sequence and
existing records are unchanged; the library edit and the renderer land together in the calc
and surfaces stage, since the calc path is where a recorded value first comes from a tool.

### What is decided here that the plan left open

For an implementer, and for a reviewer who wants to change one:

- `{var}` renders an Integer as decimal, a Real by `strconv.FormatFloat(v, 'g', -1, 64)`, a
  Boolean as `true`/`false`, a String verbatim with no quoting, and a quantity as its magnitude;
  `{var.value}` is a synonym of `{var}`; `{var.unit}` is the empty string for a unitless input.
- Templates are checked when the manifest is read: an unknown name, a stray brace and a
  reserved-word misuse refuse the entry; only an input the action did not send is a run-time
  `ToolUnsentInput`. Substitution never re-scans a rendered value.
- `cwd` and the executable are not templates; `source` admits `{outputDir}` alone.
- With `invocation` present the environment is the minimal base (`PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`,
  `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TZ`; on Windows also `SystemRoot`, `SystemDrive`, `USERPROFILE`, `TEMP`,
  `TMP`, `PATHEXT`, `COMSPEC`) plus `OPENSYSML_TOOL_ENV_PASSTHROUGH` plus `env`; without it, the
  whole parent environment as today.
- `stdin` defaults to `"json"` even under `invocation`; `"csv"` standard input is a header of
  the sent variables in `variables` order and one record of values, units not carried.
- `row` is a zero-based index over data records, the header excluded; `row` defaults to
  `"last"`.
- `type` defaults to `"number"` (Integer if the text is an integer, else Real), and is applied
  to `json` as a check against the JSON kind.
- A CSV cell is trimmed before typing except under `type: "string"`; an empty cell is
  `ToolMissingOutput`, not a default.
- `lines` splits at the first `=` or `:` and ignores lines with neither; a key or group found
  twice is malformed; `key` and `regex` are exclusive.
- `exitcode` makes a non-zero exit data rather than `ToolProcessFailed`; `success` defaults to
  `[0]`.
- `errorPath`, `errorColumn` and `errorKey` refuse only on a non-empty string — for
  `errorColumn`, any data record's cell — and are checked before outputs.
- A sequence binds only to a multiplicity above 1 and a scalar only to one of 1; neither
  direction wraps or picks; elements share one kind and one unit.
- A `reply.outputs` entry for a variable this action has no `out` for is `ToolUnknownOutput`,
  as an extra `outputs` key is today; a manifest describes one interface.
- A recorded sequence output is a typed `[0..*] ordered nonunique` attribute with a list literal, not a String of
  its text.
- The temporary directory is removed on every exit path unless `OPENSYSML_TOOL_KEEP=1`.
- Divergence compares parsed `ToolValue`s, not reply bytes.
- Provenance is a `tools : String[0..*]` attribute on `RecordedRun`, one element per call.

## User surface

Existing flags, commands, RPCs and their outputs keep their meaning. Added:

| Surface | Addition |
|---------|----------|
| CLI | `-engines` lists external engines and strategies with kind, source, resolved command, version, admitted strength and referee status, spawning nothing; `-engines -probe` also runs each entry's `describe` and reports it; `-engine <name>` selects an external engine as it selects a built-in one; `-schedule policy:<name>`; `-sampler <name>`; `-referee <engine> <dir>` |
| REPL | `%engines` shows the same; `%schedule policy:<name>`; `%sampler <name>` |
| gRPC/Connect | `ListEngines` includes external engines with a `source` field and whether the service serves them; `schedule: "policy:<name>"` and a `sampler` field on the sweep request; the `engines_external` service capability, advertised only when the service was started with `-serve-external-engines` |
| Environment | `OPENSYSML_ENGINES` beside `OPENSYSML_TOOLS`; `OPENSYSML_TOOL_TIMEOUT` bounds one message round trip for every kind; `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT` bounds one message, the captured standard error and a reply file; `OPENSYSML_TOOL_ENV_PASSTHROUGH` names the parent variables a composed invocation inherits; `OPENSYSML_TOOL_KEEP=1` keeps an invocation's temporary directory |
| Tools | `-tool-dry-run <case\|action\|calc>` and `%tool` print the composed invocation and the reply mapping without starting the process; the `protocol` column of `-engines`, `%engines` and `ListEngines` reads `object`, `argv`, `argv+csv`, `argv+json`, `argv+lines`, `argv+exitcode` or the format alone; `ToolExecution` on a `calc def` or usage; a `RecordedRun` carries `tools`, one element per tool call |
| Report | the standing line names the engine's origin and what its answer rests on: `holds? not covered: engine 'spin-bridge' reports holds, bounded at depth 40; not admitted`, `(observed on 200 executions chosen by engine 'sim-bridge', each replayed)`, `(bounded at depth 40 by engine 'spin-bridge'; refereed on 412 cases)`, `policy:priority (external; deterministic on 40 of 40 runs)` |
| Reference | `docs/reference/` gains the manifest format, the message set with its JSON Schema, the lowered-graph export format, and the referee record |

Every addition is a new flag, field, value or file under the versioning rule in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` and therefore patch material, with the same caveat the framework note
carries for `-json`: the lowered-graph export is a new output format whose later change is
minor, which is why it is versioned from its first release.

## Security

A manifest entry runs an executable with the user's privileges, as `OPENSYSML_SMT` does today
and as any tool in a build does. What the design adds is that nothing a model or a workspace
contains can cause it:

- Manifests are read from directories the environment names, and from nowhere else. A model
  names a `toolName` or, through `-engine`, an engine name; the mapping to an executable is the
  site's. A relative `command` is resolved through its links and confined to the manifest's
  directory; an entry or record writable by anyone but its owner is refused.
- `-engines` prints the path every entry resolves to, so what will run is inspectable before
  anything runs, and spawns nothing; only `-engines -probe` and a plan do.
- The LSP spawns an external engine only for a request that names one and never for a
  diagnostic, a completion or a parse.
- **The gRPC and Connect service does not run external engines unless its operator says so.**
  A request that names one is a request to run a program on the server as the service's user,
  which the client did not install and the operator may not have meant to expose. The service
  starts with external engines *listed but not served*: `ListEngines` shows them with
  `served: false`, a request naming one is refused with a typed error (*engine 'spin-bridge' is
  not served by this service*), and the `engines_external` capability is not advertised. The
  operator who wants them starts the service with `-serve-external-engines <name>,…`, naming
  the entries to serve (or `all`), and the service then runs exactly those for every
  authenticated client; there is no per-request path to a manifest, an executable or an `admit`.
  The flag is a grant of command execution and the reference names it as one: every client the
  transport admits can run every named command as the service's user, so the option belongs to a
  service whose clients are already trusted with that, and a deployment that must keep analysts
  and operators apart leaves it off and runs external engines from the CLI, where the user who
  asks is the user who runs. The transport's authentication is the transport's, not this
  design's; this design adds no client-level authorization, and says so rather than implying one
  the flag does not provide. The same holds for the `grpc` transport in the other direction: an
  engine reached at an `address` receives the model's sources, so an entry with an `address` is
  a decision to send the model there, made in the manifest and nowhere else.
- A WebAssembly module runs with no capabilities beyond the messages it is passed.
- **A composed invocation never runs a shell**, and the model influences only values, never
  what runs. The executable, `cwd`, the argument templates, the environment policy and the
  reply parser are the manifest's; after substitution every `argv` element and every `env`
  value is an opaque string handed to `exec.Command`, never re-split, never expanded, never
  re-scanned for placeholders. A String input holding `; rm -rf /` or `$(…)` is those bytes in
  one argument. A placeholder names a declared variable or one of four reserved runtime values;
  `cwd` and `executable` are confined as a relative `command` is; `source` may name only a file
  under the invocation's own `{outputDir}`, checked after cleaning and refused if it is a link.
  With `invocation` present the child sees the minimal base environment, the operator's
  passthrough list and the manifest's `env`, and nothing else of the parent's. Each invocation
  has a fresh `0700` temporary directory removed on every exit path (kept only under
  `OPENSYSML_TOOL_KEEP=1`), so two performances share no file and none leaves one. Nothing a
  tool writes is interpreted beyond the format the manifest chose: a CSV cell is a number, a
  Boolean or a String by `type`, never a path or a command.
- What an engine writes is bounded: one message and the captured standard error by
  `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT`, `progress` by coalescing, time by the deadline and
  `OPENSYSML_TOOL_TIMEOUT`; and nothing an engine writes is interpreted beyond the JSON it is
  parsed as.

## Test contract

- **Manifest:** an entry of each kind loads and lists; a malformed entry, an unknown `kind`, a
  `protocol` outside the served set, a relative `command` that names a path outside the manifest
  directory or a symbolic link inside it pointing outside, an entry or record whose file or
  directory is group- or world-writable, and a duplicate name each produce a typed error visible
  in `-engines` and register nothing; a manifest directory under the workspace is not read;
  `-engines` runs with no process spawned (asserted by an entry whose command is a script that
  records its invocation) and `-engines -probe` spawns each entry once.
- **Handshake:** a stand-in engine whose `describe` differs from its manifest in name, version,
  protocol or `answers` is refused naming the field; one that matches is used.
- **Protocol:** the stand-in exercises `covers` true and false, `run` with `progress` and a
  result of each `claim`, `cancel` at a deadline returning a bounded result, an `error` of each
  code, a line that is not JSON, a message without `jsonrpc`, a missing `id`, a line over
  `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT`, a thousand `progress` notifications in a second (the report
  prints a handful), an exit mid-run, and no answer to `cancel` (the process is ended at the
  deadline) — each producing the *not covered* result the failure table names, with `auto`
  advancing to `explore` and `-engine <name>` stopping with the reason. Run under `-race` with
  `-jobs 8` against a stand-in that answers several open requests on one process, and again
  against one that declares `concurrent: false` and asserts it never holds two open requests,
  with the plan's output identical in both.
- **Standing:** an external `holds` claimed *bounded* with no `executions` and no `admit` is
  composed *not covered* with the claim in the reason; with `executions` that replay and on
  which the claim holds it is *observed* naming their count; with one execution that fails
  replay or on which the claim fails it is *not covered* naming it; with `admit: bounded` and a
  referee record for its version and case set it is composed *bounded* naming the record; with
  a record for another version, or an edited record, it is *not covered* and `-engines` says
  why; an external `violated` whose schedule witness replays and whose condition evaluates
  `false` at the move it names is *witnessed* — including one where a later move of the same
  schedule restores the condition — and one whose schedule replays with the condition `true` at
  the named move is *not covered* naming the condition; an external `sensitive` with two schedules that
  replay to different values of the named feature is *witnessed*, with two that replay to the
  same value it is *not covered*, and with one schedule it is a protocol break; an external
  `satisfiable` whose assignment satisfies every condition under the evaluator is *witnessed*,
  and one whose assignment falsifies a condition is *not covered* naming the condition; a
  witness of the wrong kind for the question is a protocol break; one whose witness fails
  replay, or from an entry with `witness: none`, is *not covered*; an external `holds` beside an
  `explore` witness is a disagreement for the interpreter regardless of the record; `auto`
  reaches an unadmitted engine only after every built-in engine refused.
- **Referee harness:** `-referee` over the conformance corpus with a stand-in that agrees on
  every case writes a record that admits it; with a stand-in that disagrees on one case writes a
  record that does not, naming the case; a record's hash changes when the case set does.
- **Strategies:** `policy:<name>` with a stand-in policy produces a trace that replays under
  `replay:` with the policy absent; an out-of-range index and a timeout fail the run with a
  typed error naming the step; `-referee` on a deterministic stand-in records `40 of 40` and
  on one that draws names the count, and the run report cites the record or its absence;
  `explore` under `policy:<name>` is refused; `-sampler` with a stand-in produces a table validated against the ranges, and a row outside
  them is a typed error naming the row.
- **In-process Go:** a test program over `client/opensysml` registers an engine, lists it as
  `in-process`, and gets the same standing rules; `go vet` and the package's compatibility test
  cover the new exported types.
- **WebAssembly:** the stand-in policy compiled to a module gives the same trace as the process
  form on the corpus; a module that reads a file or the clock fails to instantiate with a typed
  error.
- **Wire, CLI and REPL compatibility:** `make proto-breaking` against `develop`, `make
  man-check` and the goldens pass; the JSON Schema for the message set validates every message
  the stand-ins exchange in the tests.
- **Tool invocation:** the pilot's `AnalysisAnnotation` fixture against `toolstandin` with a v1
  entry passes unchanged, with the request bytes, the reply bytes and the environment the
  stand-in saw asserted byte for byte (the regression anchor); a Python script under
  `analysis/testdata` that takes `--mass`/`--power`/`--unit`/`--out`, reads no standard input
  and writes `result.csv` into `{outputDir}` is the worked example and runs the manifest of this
  note end to end; an `args` element holding a space, a quote, a `;`, a newline and `{{`/`}}`
  arrives as one argument with those bytes (the stand-in echoes its `argv` as JSON); every
  template fault names its template and offset in `-engines` and registers nothing (unknown
  name, stray brace, `.unit` on `{uri}`, a `variables` entry spelling `outputDir`,
  `{inputFile}` without `inputFile`, `inputFile` without `{inputFile}`); a template naming an
  unsent input is `ToolUnsentInput` before any process starts (asserted by a stand-in that
  records its start); the child's environment under `invocation` is exactly the base plus
  `OPENSYSML_TOOL_ENV_PASSTHROUGH` plus `env`, a parent `OPENSYSML_TOOLS` and `SECRET` not
  among them, and without `invocation` is the parent's; `cwd` outside the manifest directory
  through `..` or a link is refused; `stdin: "none"` gives the child end-of-file; `stdin:
  "csv"` and a `csv` input file render the header and one record in `variables` order; each
  rendering rule (Integer, Real `1e-07`, Boolean, String with spaces, quantity and its
  `{var.unit}`, unitless `{var.unit}` empty) is asserted on the echoed `argv`; the temporary
  directory is gone after success, after each failure kind and after a timeout, and present
  with `OPENSYSML_TOOL_KEEP=1` and named in the report.
- **Tool replies:** for each of `json`, `csv`, `lines`, `exitcode` and `object` from a file: the
  happy path binds and converts units as the JSON protocol does; a missing member, column, row,
  key or group is `ToolMissingOutput` naming the place; a `null`, an object at a pointer, a
  ragged record, a header name absent or repeated, `row` past the end, a non-number under
  `type: "number"`, `12.0` under `"integer"`, `yes` under `"boolean"`, a string at a
  `"number"` pointer, a repeated key, a group matched twice, an unknown unit, a differing unit
  across `row: "all"`, a mixed-kind array, a scalar for a `[0..*]` parameter and an array for a
  scalar one are each `ToolMalformed` with the variable and the pointer, column and row, or key
  and line in the detail; `errorPath`, `errorColumn` and `errorKey` with a message are
  `ToolRefused` with that message and with an empty string are not; a non-zero exit is
  `ToolProcessFailed` quoting standard error under every format but `exitcode`, where `0` and
  `3` under `success: [0, 3]` bind `true` and `1` binds `false` and, under `type:
  "integer"`, `3` binds `3`; a file the tool did not write, a link at its path, a path
  escaping `{outputDir}`, and a file over `OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT` are refused naming the
  path; a reply a v1 entry would have accepted is accepted identically under `format:
  "object"` with a `source: "file:…"`; two invocations with equal inputs whose CSV spells
  `341.20` and `341.2` do not diverge and whose values differ do; every reply-side manifest
  fault (`outputs` naming a non-variable, `unit` beside `unitColumn`, `key` beside `regex`, a
  group naming no output, `exitcode` with two outputs, a negative `row`, a two-character
  `delimiter`, `format: "object"` with `outputs`) registers nothing and names the field.
- **Sequences:** `row: "all"` and a JSON array bind to `Real[0..*]`, convert each element's
  unit, record as `(…)` with the element type, render in a document table, replay under
  `check`, and are a free output under `smt`; an empty CSV under `"all"` binds the empty
  sequence to `[0..*]` and is refused for `[1..*]` by the runtime's multiplicity check.
- **Calc:** `ToolExecution` on a `calc def` reached from an attribute binding, `calc`, `%calc`,
  `EvaluateCalc` and a document formula runs the tool once per evaluation and never the body
  (the body asserts by failing); a failure fails the evaluation with the same `ToolError`; the
  result is *observed* and a divergence is reported.
- **Surfaces:** `-tool-dry-run` and `%tool` over the worked example print the composed
  invocation with `<outputDir>` and start no process (the stand-in records its start); the
  `protocol` column reads each value the note lists; a golden for `-engines` with a v1 entry is
  unchanged; a record of a run through the worked example carries `tools` with the tool, its
  version, the manifest path and the argument list; `make man-check` and `make proto-breaking`
  pass.

## Stages

Each stage is a pull request into `develop` that leaves the gate green. The stages depend on the
framework's: none starts before the framework's surface stage (`-engines`, `-engine`, the
standing line) and its tools stage (the manifest, the tool protocol) are merged, since this
design extends both; the first stage also needs the `replay:` policy, which the SMT design's
first stage delivers, since it is the gate every external witness passes through.

1. **External engines over standard input.** The manifest entry format for `engine`, read from
   `OPENSYSML_ENGINES`; the session, the message set and its JSON Schema; the `sources` and
   `graphs:1` model forms, the latter as the new versioned export of lowered graphs; the failure
   table; the output bounds; the standing rules without admission — witnesses of both kinds
   checked and the claim evaluated at the replay point they name, two schedules for `sensitive`,
   `executions` replayed for *observed*, every other universal claim *not covered*
   with the claim kept (`admit` is refused until the next stage); the stand-in engine and its
   tests; `-engines`, `-engines -probe`, `%engines` and `ListEngines` listing external engines,
   the service refusing to run them until `-serve-external-engines`; the reference pages.
   *Implemented:* `internal/exec/analysis` reads both directories through one
   `manifest.go` (`EntryKind` distinguishing `tool`, `engine`, `policy` and `sampler`;
   `ManifestsFromEnv` reading `OPENSYSML_TOOLS` then `OPENSYSML_ENGINES`, `ExternalsFromEnv`
   registering every entry of both), the `engine` entry in `engine_entry.go`
   with the security rules of this note (`confinedPath` for `command`, and for a tool's
   `executable` when it is a relative path; a directory under a workspace not read; duplicate
   names refused across both directories), the session in `session.go` (one process per plan,
   `describe` checked field by field, `covers`, `run`, `cancel`, coalesced `progress` through
   `analysis.Reporter` at `ProgressInterval`, ids matched, the failure table of `external.go`
   and `external_standing.go`), the wire types in `enginewire` with the schema at
   `docs/reference/engine-protocol.schema.json`, and the bounded process I/O of `process.go`
   shared with the tool engine (`OPENSYSML_TOOL_MAX_OUTPUT`, default 64 MiB, one message and
   the captured standard error). `graphs:1` is `modelform.GraphsOf` over the lowered
   `ActionGraph` and `StateGraph`, the footprints that `lower.Footprints` computes included;
   `sources` is `modelform.SourcesOf`. Standing is the framework's: a `violated` schedule replays
   through `runtime.ReplaySchedule` under the `replay:` policy as the `check` engine's witnesses
   do, and the condition is evaluated at the move named, `sensitive` needs two replaying
   schedules that end the feature differently, `satisfiable` an assignment the solver query's
   `Confirm` accepts against the semantic model, `executions` replayed for *observed*;
   every other universal claim is *not covered* with the claim kept. Surfaces: `-engines`
   spawns nothing, `-engines -probe` and `%engines probe` start each engine once,
   `ListEngines` gains `kind`, `protocol`, `source`, `command`, `version` and `served`, and
   `sysml-grpc -serve-external-engines <names|all>` advertises `engines_external`. Decided
   here: `progress` is printed to standard error by the CLI and REPL — at most one line per
   quarter second per open run, the latest kept for the reason of a run that ends unanswered —
   since nothing on `develop` printed `explore`'s; a schedule witness carrying `inputs` is
   replayed through the same path as the SMT engine's, the inputs fixed before the first move
   on the features the question leaves free (`question.inputs`), one it does not free being
   *not covered* naming it, and a result's own `inputs` and `assumptions` are kept as the SMT
   engine's are; an entry naming
   the `grpc` transport, the `rdf` form or a `module`, or of `policy` or `sampler` kind, is
   parsed and listed `unavailable` with the typed `NotServedError` naming its stage, and one
   naming `admit` is refused as the note says. Still deferred: referee records and `admit`
   (stage 2); `policy` and `sampler` strategies and the `rdf` form (stage 3); in-process Go
   (stage 4); WebAssembly (stage 5); the `grpc` transport.
2. **Referee records.** `-referee <engine> <dir>`, the record format and its placement and
   permission rules, `admit` honored against a matching record, the standing line naming it,
   the disagreement tests.
3. **Strategies.** `policy` and `sampler` entries; `-schedule policy:<name>` through the
   scheduler seam and `-sampler <name>` through the sweep plan; the determinism report; the
   `rdf` model form for engines, since it costs one call to the existing export.
4. **In-process Go.** The contract types and `WithEngine` in `client/opensysml`, the
   lowered-graph export as Go values, `WithEngineAdmit`, the example `main`, the reference.
5. **WebAssembly host.** The `module` entry, the runtime, the `handle` ABI, the stand-in policy
   as a module, the capability tests.

The `grpc` transport is defined in stage 1 and implemented when the first remote engine needs
it; the messages do not change.

The tool stages are independent of the engine stages above and of each other's later members,
since they touch the tool entry, `tool.go` and `runtime/tool.go` and no session or strategy
code. The first three are ordered; the last two each depend only on the third:

1. **Composed invocation.** `ToolEntry.Invocation`, the template grammar and its load-time
   checks, the rendering rules, the minimal base environment and `OPENSYSML_TOOL_ENV_PASSTHROUGH`,
   `cwd` confinement, the four `stdin` shapes, `inputFile`, the temporary directory and
   `OPENSYSML_TOOL_KEEP`, `ToolUnsentInput` for an unsent template variable; the reply is still
   `ToolReplyOf` on standard output. The `protocol` column reads `argv`. The v1 regression
   anchor is asserted byte for byte in this stage, before anything else moves.
2. **Structured replies.** `ToolEntry.Reply`, `source`, the `json`, `csv`, `lines` and
   `exitcode` readers each producing a `map[string]runtime.ToolValue` for `Bind`, `type`,
   `unit`/`unitPath`/`unitColumn`, `errorPath`/`errorColumn`/`errorKey`, the error details
   naming pointer, column and row, key and line; `renderReply` over parsed values for
   divergence; the worked Python example, scalar outputs only (`row: "all"` and an array are
   refused with a typed error naming this stage).
3. **Sequences.** `ToolValue.Items`, `row: "all"` and array pointers, the multiplicity rule in
   `Bind`, `ValSequence` construction and unit conversion per element, the record's sequence
   shape and `renderReply` over `Items`.
4. **Tools on calc definitions.** `ToolRunner` on the `EvalContext`, the annotation consulted
   in `calcUsageRun`, the body never entered, standing and divergence as for an action; the
   `tools` attribute of `RecordedRun` and its renderer, since a recorded value now first comes
   from a tool by way of a calc.
5. **Surfaces.** `-tool-dry-run`, `%tool`, the `ToolDryRun` runner and its report, the
   `protocol` values in every listing, the reference page for the v2 entry and the guide's
   worked example.

## What this does not change

- The built-in engines, their strengths and their referee role. `explore` remains the referee;
  an external engine is measured against it and never the reverse.
- The framework's rules. Every rule here is one of the framework's applied to an engine whose
  code is not this repository's: `Covers` refuses before work, a witness replays or is *not
  covered*, a budget reached is never a proof, completion order decides nothing, a
  contradiction is a disagreement for the interpreter, *observed* names executions the
  interpreter ran. The one addition is `admit`, and it never raises a claim above what the
  engine itself claimed, nor above *not covered* without a record.
- The tool manifest's v1 meaning. `OPENSYSML_TOOLS` and the `tool:<name>` engine are as the
  framework note designs them; a tool entry gains nothing and loses nothing by the second
  directory, and an entry without `invocation` and `reply` runs, reads and is listed exactly as
  before: no arguments, the whole parent environment, the parent's working directory, the JSON
  object on standard input and `ToolReplyOf` on standard output, `protocol` `object`.
- The model's vocabulary for tools. `ToolExecution` and `ToolVariable` are the whole of what a
  model says; no annotation names an argument, a parser, a file or an environment, and none
  will.
- No accepted model is refused, no result changes, no flag, command, RPC or field is removed or
  renamed. A model that names no tool and a session that sets no manifest see nothing new but
  an empty section in `-engines`.

## Alternatives considered

- **Go plugins.** Rejected by the framework note for reasons that have not changed; the
  in-process form for Go is the public package, whose compatibility surface the repository
  already commits to.
- **Trust an external engine's claimed strength.** The scale would then say *proved* of a
  result nothing here checked, which is the laundering the framework exists to prevent. The
  site can grant it, visibly and against a record; the default cannot.
- **Print an unadmitted external universal claim as *observed*.** It reads as the tool rule
  (*a tool's answer is observed*) and keeps the answer visible, but it says something false:
  *observed* means the interpreter ran executions and saw the claim hold on them, and a model
  checker's `holds` ran none. Keeping the claim in a *not covered* result's reason shows the
  reader the same words without asserting evidence that does not exist, and an engine that
  does execute earns *observed* the honest way, by handing over its executions to replay.
- **Sign referee records.** A signature would let a record travel; but a record only ever
  vouches for an entry in its own directory, whose `command` already runs arbitrary code, so
  the signature would guard a smaller privilege than the file beside it grants. Confining the
  record to that directory and refusing loose permissions guards the boundary that exists.
- **Serve external engines over gRPC by default when the manifest names them.** The manifest is
  the operator's, but a service is started for clients the operator may not know, and running a
  local program for a remote request is a decision the two settings should have to agree on.
- **Discover engines on `PATH` by a naming convention** (`sysml-engine-*`). Any program on
  `PATH` could then register itself into an analysis; the manifest makes the registration a
  file the site wrote and `-engines` can show.
- **Let a model name its engine.** The `AnalysisTooling` metadata names a tool by a name the
  site maps; naming an executable in a model would move the site's decision into the artifact
  the site receives from others.
- **One message per invocation for engines, as for tools.** A question that takes minutes
  needs cancellation and progress, and an engine that warms a solver per question would pay it
  per question; the session costs one long-lived process per plan, which the solver already is.
- **A binary protocol.** The tool protocol, the LSP and the stdio transport are all JSON on
  standard input; an engine author has a JSON library in every language and a schema to
  validate against, and the messages are small beside the model they carry.
- **Hand the engine an in-memory model over gRPC callbacks** instead of the sources and graphs.
  It would let an engine query the host's resolver lazily, at the cost of a second protocol and
  a session per callback; the sources and the versioned graph export are self-contained, can be
  saved with a result, and are what a reproducible run needs anyway.
