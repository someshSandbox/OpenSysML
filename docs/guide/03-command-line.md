# 3. From the command line

Every check the REPL performs is also available as a command-line flag, so you can check a model
from a script, a Makefile or a continuous integration job without a prompt. This
chapter explains the workflow; every flag and exit status is listed in
[reference/cli.md](../reference/cli.md).

The examples below use the following model, `checks.sysml`:

```sysml
package MyModel {
    part def Sensor {
        attribute reading default = 0.0;
        attribute threshold = 100.0;
    }

    requirement def ReadingRequirement {
        subject sensor : Sensor;
        require constraint {
            sensor.reading <= sensor.threshold
        }
    }
    requirement healthy : ReadingRequirement;

    part hot : Sensor {
        attribute :>> reading = 140.0;
        constraint inRange { reading <= threshold }
    }
    part cold : Sensor {
        attribute :>> reading = 20.0;
        constraint inRange { reading <= threshold }
    }

    part checks {
        assert satisfy healthy by cold;
        assert satisfy healthy by hot;
    }

    calc def Margin {
        in reading;
        in threshold;
        threshold - reading
    }

    action calibrate {
        attribute offset = 0.0;
        first start;
        then action adjust {
            assign offset := offset + 1.5;
        }
        then done;
    }

    state Monitor {
        entry;
        then off;
        state off;
        state warming;
        accept after 10 [SI::s] then running;
        state running;
        transition first off then warming;
    }
}
```

Each flag may be repeated. `-instantiate` always runs first, whatever order the flags are
written in, so the verdicts that follow apply to the object it created. The object is created
whole — the parts nested in it whose types exhibit or perform behaviors are created and run
with it — so an `-e` expression naming the usage or a feature under it (`-e "ctx.recv.got"`)
reads what that object holds after its behaviors ran, as `%features` shows it:

```bash
$ sysml -instantiate MyModel::cold -constraint MyModel::cold::inRange checks.sysml
✓ package MyModel
✓ Created instance of MyModel::cold
  ID: 1
  Use %features MyModel::cold to inspect
✓ Constraint MyModel::cold::inRange passed (on MyModel::cold ID: 1)
  standing: holds (observed: 1 run under reverse)

$ sysml -satisfy checks.sysml
✓ package MyModel
✓ satisfy healthy by cold holds (on MyModel::cold ID: 1)
  standing: holds (observed: 1 run under reverse)
✗ satisfy healthy by hot fails (on MyModel::hot ID: 2)
  Required condition evaluated to false: sensor.reading <= sensor.threshold
  standing: violated (witnessed: 1 run under reverse)
```

The `standing:` line under each verdict says what the verdict rests on: the claim, the strength
of the evidence and what earned it. One run under the default schedule is *observed* evidence
that a condition holds, and a run that shows it false is a *witnessed* violation. Every check is
a question put to an analysis engine — `run` here; `-engines` lists them and `-engine` picks
one, or `all` to have every engine that covers the question answer it and compare their
answers ([Analysis engines](../reference/cli.md#analysis-engines)). `-engine check` searches
every schedule of an action or a state machine — of several named together, run on one clock
to `-advance` — for a violation, and `-engine smt` decides a property over every
schedule and every value of the inputs the model leaves unbound — or that `-check-input` frees —
with an SMT solver, so its *proved* stands for any input in its declared domain where a run's
*observed* stands for the inputs as written
([Deciding a property over the inputs](../reference/cli.md#deciding-a-property-over-the-inputs)).
`-check-diverge <feature>` asks either checker whether the schedule decides a feature's final
value: `check` searches the schedules for two that end it differently, `smt` asks a solver for
two at once, and a *sensitive* verdict comes with both schedules as witnesses, each replayable
([Deciding whether the schedule decides a feature](../reference/cli.md#deciding-whether-the-schedule-decides-a-feature)).
A model checker or a simulator installed beside OpenSysML joins them through one JSON file in
the directory `OPENSYSML_ENGINES` names; `-engines` lists it without starting it,
`-engines -probe` starts it once to check that it describes itself as its file does, and
`-engine <name>` puts a check to it — its witness replayed by the interpreter before the
verdict stands ([External engines](../reference/external-engines.md)). `-jobs <n>` (or
`OPENSYSML_JOBS`) lets `n` runs of one check go at once — an exploration's linearizations, a sweep's rows, the
engines `all` consults — without changing what is reported: the result is the same at any count
([Running in parallel](../reference/cli.md#running-in-parallel)).

Every check flag is listed in
[reference/cli.md § Command Reference](../reference/cli.md#command-reference). You can check
one constraint or requirement by name, every satisfaction assertion the model
states, a calculation, an action, or a state machine, and add `-json` for a machine-readable
report.

Build steps can gate on the exit status. It follows the same rules for every non-interactive
run, whether that is a check, an evaluation, a conversion or a plain load: `0` when the requested
operation succeeded, `1` when the model answered false, and `2` when nothing was decided. The full
contract is in [reference/cli.md § Exit status](../reference/cli.md#exit-status).

Status 2 is kept separate from status 1 because an undecided check is not evidence against the
model: treat it as a broken check rather than a failing one. A condition that
evaluates to false is the model's own answer; an unresolved name, or a condition over a feature
that has no value, is not:

```bash
$ sysml -constraint MyModel::hot::inRange -instantiate MyModel::hot checks.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
✓ package MyModel
✓ Created instance of MyModel::hot
  ID: 1
  Use %features MyModel::hot to inspect
✗ Constraint MyModel::hot::inRange failed (on MyModel::hot ID: 1)
  Assertion evaluated to false: reading <= threshold
  standing: violated (witnessed: 1 run under reverse)
exit=1

$ sysml -constraint MyModel::nosuch checks.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
✓ package MyModel
sysml: unresolved reference: MyModel::nosuch
exit=2

$ sysml -requirement MyModel::healthy checks.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
✓ package MyModel
? Requirement MyModel::healthy could not be evaluated
  Error: requirement healthy: sensor subject is unbound: bind it (`subject sensor = <element>`), check it on an object, or assert `satisfy healthy by <element>`
  standing: not covered (requirement healthy: sensor subject is unbound: bind it (`subject sensor = <element>`), check it on an object, or assert `satisfy healthy by <element>`)
exit=2
```

The last case shows a requirement that declares a `subject` that nothing binds,
so the requirement has no object to evaluate against. Declare the intended pairing in the model
as `assert satisfy healthy by hot;` and check it with `-satisfy`, which creates the subject
itself. `-requirement` is for a requirement whose conditions stand on their own, or one
carried by a part that `-instantiate` created.

Verdicts go to standard output. Undecided checks and everything else, including diagnostics
and warnings, go to standard error. So
`sysml -satisfy checks.sysml > verdicts.txt` records the results in the file and leaves any
problems visible on the terminal.

## Checking as a gate

`-validate` does not evaluate any of the model's conditions. It loads the model and reports
what analysis found. Run it as a lint step before relying on any verdict.

```bash
$ sysml -validate checks.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
✓ package MyModel
✓ checks.sysml: no errors
exit=0

$ sysml -validate bad.sysml; echo "exit=$?"   # a file with a syntax error in it
bad.sysml:2:45: error: expected an expression
    part def Battery { attribute capacity = ; }
                                            ^
sysml: bad.sysml did not analyse cleanly; no check was made
exit=2
```

A single `-` stands for standard input wherever a file name is accepted, so you can pipe a model
in; its diagnostics are reported against `<stdin>`. To read a file that is actually named `-`,
write `./-`. `-convert` needs `-from` for piped input, because a stream has no file
extension to infer the format from.

```bash
$ cat checks.sysml | sysml -validate -
✓ package MyModel
✓ <stdin>: no errors

$ cat checks.sysml | sysml - -convert ttl -from sysml > model.ttl
```

Every check mode is gated the same way, so a model containing an error never reports a
verdict about itself: a condition read from a model the tool could not fully parse would
describe a different model from the one you wrote. Name as many files as the model
spans, in any order. The gate applies to the model as a whole, so a reference from one file to
a declaration in another resolves correctly.

## Strict conformance

OpenSysML accepts several notations of its own that no SysML v2 production admits: `defer`, and
the `choice`, `junction` and `history` pseudostates. These are reported as
warnings, so a model that uses them still analyses cleanly. `-strict` promotes those warnings
to errors, which turns the run into a test of whether the file is conforming SysML v2. The flag
applies to `-convert` from XMI too: a strict SysML v1 migration writes no extension notation
at all — see [Portable output with `-strict`](../reference/sysml-v1-migration.md#portable-output-with--strict).

The state machine below uses the `defer` extension so the difference is visible:

```sysml
package M {
    attribute def Alarm;
    state monitor {
        entry; then off;
        state off {
            defer Alarm;
        }
        state warming;
        accept after 10 [SI::s] then done;
        succession first off then warming;
    }
}
```

```bash
$ sysml -validate monitor.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
monitor.sysml:6:13: warning: `defer <event>;` is an OpenSysML extension with no SysML v2 production: no notation states a deferred event
            defer Alarm;
            ^~~~~
✓ package M
✓ monitor.sysml: no errors
exit=0

$ sysml -strict -validate monitor.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
monitor.sysml:6:13: error: `defer <event>;` is an OpenSysML extension with no SysML v2 production: no notation states a deferred event
            defer Alarm;
            ^~~~~
sysml: monitor.sysml did not analyse cleanly; no check was made
exit=2
```

There is no standard notation for a deferred event, so a portable model marks the machine's
completion with `then done;`, as `warming` does above, and leaves out the `defer`. `-strict` does not
change what parses: the same file produces the same tree and the same findings in the same
places. Only their severity changes, and with it the exit status and the tier gate. It is a
portability check, so turn it on when another SysML v2 tool has to read the model and leave
it off otherwise. Each finding names the standard notation to use instead, and
[the conformance audit](../reference/grammar/conformance-audit.md) cites the grammar production
each extension is measured against. The same setting is available as `%strict` at the prompt
([4. The REPL](04-repl.md)), as the `sysml.strictConformance` editor setting
([8. Editors](08-editors.md)) and as `strict_conformance=True` from Python
([9. From your own program](09-clients.md#from-python)).

## Running behavior

The debuggers have non-interactive forms that run to completion and report the values they
produce. `-calc` takes a call expression, while `-action` and `-state` take the name of the
behavior, optionally followed by the object performing it:

```bash
$ sysml -calc "MyModel::Margin(20.0, 100.0)" checks.sysml
✓ package MyModel
✓ MyModel::Margin(20.0, 100.0)
  = 80.0
  standing: value (observed: 1 run under reverse)

$ sysml -action MyModel::calibrate checks.sysml
✓ package MyModel
✓ Started action executor for "MyModel::calibrate"
  State: Running
  Tokens: 1
✓ Action completed
  Final state: Completed
  Results:
    offset = 1.5
  standing: value (observed: 1 run under reverse)

$ sysml -state MyModel::Monitor -advance 15 checks.sysml
✓ package MyModel
✓ Started state machine executor for "MyModel::Monitor"
  Current state: off
  Time: 0.0
  Events: 1
✓ Advanced to 15.0 (2 event(s) processed)
  Current state: running
  Last event at: 10.0
  Remaining events: 0
  standing: value (observed: 1 run under reverse)
```

An analysis case is a calculation performed as an action, so `-analysis` runs it the way
`-calc` invokes a calc and `-requirement` checks a requirement: it names the case, optionally
with arguments in parentheses that bind the case's `in` parameters (positionally or by name),
and optionally an object to run it on, which becomes the case's `subject`. The report lists the
case's `out` and `return` values with their units, then the verdict of its `objective`
(`satisfied`, `not satisfied` with the violated condition, or `undecided` with the reason):

```sysml
package An {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    part def Ship {
        attribute cost : Real default = 5.0;
        attribute other : Real default = 7.0;
    }
    calc def Sum { in a : Real; in b : Real; return : Real = a + b; }
    analysis def CostAnalysis {
        subject s : Ship;
        in limit : Real = 20.0;
        out total : Real = Sum(s.cost, s.other);
        objective affordable { require constraint { total <= limit } }
    }
    part ship : Ship;
    part barge : Ship { attribute :>> cost = 30.0; }
    analysis shipCost : CostAnalysis { subject s = ship; }
}
```

```bash
$ sysml -analysis An::shipCost analysis.sysml
✓ package An
✓ An::shipCost
  total = 12.0
  objective affordable: satisfied
  standing: value (observed: 1 run under reverse)

$ sysml -instantiate An::barge -analysis "An::CostAnalysis An::barge" \
    -analysis "An::CostAnalysis(limit = 50.0) An::barge" analysis.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
✓ package An
✓ Created instance of An::barge
  ID: 1
  Use %features An::barge to inspect
✗ An::CostAnalysis on object #1 of "An::barge"
  total = 37.0
  objective affordable: not satisfied: total <= limit
  standing: value (observed: 1 run under reverse)
✓ An::CostAnalysis(limit = 50.0) on object #1 of "An::barge"
  total = 37.0
  objective affordable: satisfied
  standing: value (observed: 1 run under reverse)
exit=1

$ sysml -analysis An::CostAnalysis analysis.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
✓ package An
sysml: analysis run failed: analysis An::CostAnalysis: s subject is unbound: bind it (`subject s = <element>`) or run it on an object
  objective affordable: undecided: analysis An::CostAnalysis: s subject is unbound: bind it (`subject s = <element>`) or run it on an object
  standing: not covered (analysis An::CostAnalysis: s subject is unbound: bind it (`subject s = <element>`) or run it on an object)
exit=2
```

A usage that binds its subject (`subject s = ship;`) needs no object; a definition, or a usage
that binds none, needs one, and is refused by name when none is given — the same rule
`-requirement` applies. The object is one `-instantiate` created, named as `-state` names its
performer. A case whose body performs `action` steps sequenced by `then` runs them as an
action does, each later step reading the outputs of the earlier ones; a body stating no
successions runs its steps in declaration order. An objective violated exits with status 1,
one that could not be decided (a value the condition needs is missing) with status 2, and a
case that stops before producing its outputs — an unbound subject or `in` parameter, a step
that fails, a deadlocked body or one that exhausts the step budget — is reported as an error
naming the case. `-e` reads the results of a package-level usage or of one nested in a part
(`-e An::shipCost.total`, `-e An::holder.inner.total`) by running the case once and keeping
what it computed until a value it depends on changes.

A trade study (`TradeStudies::TradeStudy`) is an analysis case and runs the same way: the
library's own expressions score each alternative the subject lists with the case's
`evaluationFunction` and return the first that scores best. The report adds one line per
evaluation, in subject order, marking the alternative selected and any that tied with it
(`evaluationFunction(An::b (object #2)) = 10.0 [selected]`); `-json` carries them as each
check's `evaluations`. See [Trade studies](06-behavior.md#trade-studies).

A parameter can be swept rather than fixed. `-sweep <param>=<from>..<to>[:<step>]` runs the
`-analysis` case or the `-calc` once per value of the range instead of once, each run an
ordinary run with that value bound and every other argument as given, and reports the runs as
a table of the inputs, the outputs, the verdict and the time that run took:

```bash
$ sysml -instantiate An::barge -analysis "An::CostAnalysis An::barge" \
    -sweep "limit=30.0..40.0:5.0" analysis.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
✓ package An
✓ Created instance of An::barge
  ID: 1
  Use %features An::barge to inspect
sweep An::CostAnalysis — 3 run(s)
limit | total | verdict                   | time
------+-------+---------------------------+--------
30.0  | 37.0  | affordable: not satisfied | 0.416ms
35.0  | 37.0  | affordable: not satisfied | 0.019ms
40.0  | 37.0  | affordable: satisfied     | 0.012ms
  standing: table (observed: 3 rows)
exit=1
```

`-samples <n> -seed <s>` draws `n` values for each range instead of running every value of it,
uniformly and in draw order, so a range needs no step; the seed is required and the table
echoes it, and the same seed draws the same values on every platform (the `time` column is the
wall time each run took, so it is the one column two runs of the same table do not share):

```bash
$ sysml -calc "An::Sum(2.0)" -sweep "b=0.0..10.0" -samples 3 -seed 42 analysis.sysml
✓ package An
samples An::Sum — 3 run(s), seed 42
b                  | result             | time
-------------------+--------------------+--------
8.254725069980449  | 10.254725069980449 | 0.035ms
0.4281995136143024 | 2.4281995136143024 | 0.001ms
7.76073049711954   | 9.760730497119539  | 0.000ms
  standing: table (observed: 3 rows)
```

The endpoints and step carry the syntax and the units an argument carries
(`0.0 [SI::m]..10.0 [SI::m]:2.0 [SI::m]`), `<to>` is included where the step lands on it, a
range between Integers with no step steps by one, and a range between Reals with no step is
refused rather than guessed at. Several `-sweep` flags run their cartesian product, the first
flag varying slowest. A run that fails is a row numbering its error, printed in full under the
table, and the runs after it are still made, so a sweep through a singularity reports which
value broke rather than losing the table. A step of zero, a step whose sign never reaches
`<to>`, an endpoint or step that is not a finite number, a unit that does not convert, a parameter the target declares none of, a case's subject,
one the arguments already bind, and a sweep or sample without an `-analysis`/`-calc` are refused:

```bash
$ sysml -calc "An::Sum(2.0, 3.0)" -sweep "b=0.0..10.0" analysis.sysml; echo "exit=$?"
sysml: invalid sweep parameter: b is both an argument of the invocation and swept
exit=2
```

Sampling is uniform over the range: the bundled library states no probability distribution, so
a distribution asked for by name is refused naming what is missing rather than approximated.
`OPENSYSML_MAX_SWEEP_RUNS` bounds how many runs one table may make (1000 by default), counted
before the first run, and `-json` reports the same rows inside the check the sweep ran. The
REPL's [`%sweep` and `%samples`](04-repl.md#command-summary) do the same interactively.

A state machine takes only its initial transition unless `-advance` says how much simulated
time to run for. `-advance 0` runs the machine up to the present, dispatching whatever is already
due. The `-action` and `-state` behaviors of one invocation run on one simulation clock, so
`-advance` moves them together: an action that `accept after 5 [SI::s]` and a machine that
accepts the signal it then sends both settle under `-advance 5`, and what comes due at the same
instant in two behaviors runs in the order the scheduling policy `-schedule` names picks (the
behavior started last first by default), reported as a choice point. Without `-advance`, an
action runs to completion on its own, moving the clock to each wait as it reaches it; with it, the action runs only as far as that much time
takes it, and one still parked on the clock when the time is up is reported as undecided with
the instant it waits for. `-advance` without an `-action` or `-state` to run is reported as a
mistake rather than silently ignored. An action that stops before completing, whether through
deadlock or by hitting the step budget, is reported as an undecided check (status 2), because it
produced no outputs to evaluate.

The object after the name is one `-instantiate` created, written as `%state` takes it: the
usage's name, a feature path to a part it holds (`-state "Fleet::driver.r"`, or
`-state "Fleet::Rover::modes Fleet::driver.r"`), or the id the report prints (`-state "#2"`).
Naming the machine the object exhibits attaches to its running machine, with a note saying so,
rather than performing it a second time; a definition the object exhibits as several usages is
refused with the usages to name instead. The object must be the *usage*: `-instantiate
Fleet::rover` gives `-state "Fleet::Rover::modes Fleet::rover"` its object, while `-instantiate
Fleet::Rover` creates an object of the definition, which the flag reports as such — `no instance
of the usage "Fleet::rover": object #1 of "Fleet::Rover" is of its definition "Fleet::Rover",
not of the usage — use %instantiate Fleet::rover to create the usage's object, or name
Fleet::Rover to address it` (the prompt's `%instantiate` is the flag's `-instantiate`). A path
that stops short of an object names the segment that failed.

## Machine-readable results

`-json` reports the same run as a single JSON document, so a build step can read structured
data instead of parsing `✓` and `✗` markers. It reports the checks, not the model; use
`-convert` to serialize the model itself.

`status` is the worst verdict reached, and `exit` is the code the process exits with.
Values produced by a calculation or a state machine appear under `values`. What analysis
found appears under `diagnostics`, covering both the warnings of a model that analyses cleanly
and the errors of one that does not, each with the `file`, `line` and `column` where it
occurs. Anything that prevented a check from being made appears under `errors`. Each check's
`plan` says which engines were asked and what each did (and, under `-jobs`, how many `workers`
it built and the milliseconds of `warming` spent building them), and `results` holds one entry
per engine that answered, with the strength of its evidence, the bounds it ran under and the witness behind
a violation ([Analysis engines](../reference/cli.md#analysis-engines)). The whole document goes
to standard output, so nothing needs to be read from standard error.

## Running from a script

`-e` evaluates an expression without entering the prompt, so you can query a model from a
shell:

```bash
$ sysml -e "RdfInteropDemo::Rover::mass" examples/rdf-interop-demo.sysml
✓ package RdfInteropDemo
✓ RdfInteropDemo::Rover::mass
  = 899.0
```

Two things are worth knowing before a pipeline depends on this:

- **Results go to standard output and problems go to standard error.** Evaluated
  values, conversion output and verdict lines are results. A model's diagnostics and warnings,
  a failed evaluation, a file that could not be read, and even the `wrote <file> …` note of a
  successful `-convert -o` are not, so standard output carries the conversion alone.
- **The exit status says whether the model answered the question**: `0` if it did, `1`
  if it answered false, and `2` if it answered nothing. A warning leaves the status at `0`. The
  status codes are documented in
  [reference/cli.md § Exit status](../reference/cli.md#exit-status), along with a continuous
  integration recipe that gates on them.
