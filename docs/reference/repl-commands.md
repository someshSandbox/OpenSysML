# REPL meta-commands

Every command `sysml` accepts at the prompt. The session model behind them (what a submission
replaces, what it drops) is explained in [guide chapter 4](../guide/04-repl.md).

Every command that takes a `<name>` accepts the quoted spelling the notation uses, including a
quoted segment containing a space and a quoted segment in the middle of a chain:
`%instantiate 'My Pkg'::Car`, `%features Top::'My Pkg'::Car`. A name holding a character no
basic name can — `'SA-506'`, `'HLR-R001'`, `'My Pkg'` — is typed with its quotes. A command
reading a `<name>` alone also finds the declaration under the bare spelling, but an `<object>`
reference and an expression read only the identifier it starts with: `T::SA-506` is `T::SA`
followed by `-506`, and where an expression is expected, the subtraction `T::SA - 506`. When
that identifier names nothing but is the start of a declared name that does need quotes, every
command's failure says so, offering the quoted spelling:

```
sysml> %instantiate T::SA
error: unresolved reference: T::SA — did you mean T::'SA-506'? Names containing '-' must be quoted.
```

The offer is drawn from what is declared — a name in scope, or one of the kinds the command acts
on, whose unquoted spelling starts with what was typed — never from the rest of the text; the
characters named are the ones those declarations hold (`Names containing ' ' or '-' must be
quoted.`), and a plain misspelling is still offered its nearest declared name.

Every command that takes an `<object>` — `%features`, `%invoke`, `%eval in`, and the object
`%action` and `%state` are performed by or attached to — reads one
[object reference](#object-references): the name an object was instantiated under
(`car`, `Demo::car`), its id as `%instantiate` printed it (`#3`), or either followed by a path
into the parts it holds (`car.fl.hub`, `#3.fl`, `car.wheels[2]`).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `%help` | Show help message |
| `%list` | List all declarations in current session |
| `%clear` | Clear session (reset all declarations) |
| `%load <path>...` | Submit the contents of files, directories or globs |
| `%print [name]` | Print the session model as SysML notation at the prompt, or only the named element and its body (`%print 'My Pkg'::Car`). Comments are kept, since the same writer `%save` writes notation with is used, and what is printed can be typed back in. Notation only: nothing about RDF is reported. Reading the model materializes nothing and leaves a debugging session running |
| `%save <file>` | Write the session model to a file: `.sysml` notation (comments preserved), `.ttl` RDF or `.json` the API's element form, which are [experimental](rdf-mapping.md#status-experimental) and reported as such on each save |
| `%query <oslc-query>` | Identify model elements using OSLC Query text |
| `%verbosity [level]` | Show or set output level: `quiet` (errors only), `normal`, `debug` (every diagnostic over the whole buffer) |
| `%trace [on\|off]` | Show or set execution tracing: each evaluation, calc invocation, action step and state transition, and each `choice` the executor made among alternatives the library leaves unordered — several steppable tokens, several holding decision guards, several enabled transitions out of one state for one event, several regions of one parallel state reacting to one event, two tokens writing one feature in one step, two executors due at one instant of the clock — naming the alternatives and the one taken, and each `unevaluable guard` it read only to report one and could not evaluate ([Choice points](../guide/06-behavior.md)). `%step`, `%continue` and `%advance` end with a count of the choices they made and of the guards they could not evaluate (`1 choice point; 1 guard not evaluable`) whether or not tracing is on |
| `%schedule [<policy>]` | Show or set the scheduling policy the executors resolve their [choice points](../guide/06-behavior.md) under: `reverse` (the default: reverse token order, first holding guard, first enabled transition), `declared` (spawn and declaration order), `seed:<n>` (a pseudo-random order the non-negative integer `n` fixes, so the same seed replays the same run) or `replay:<file>` (the choice lines of a witness, followed move for move and then `reverse`'s picks one token a step — a header of `no choice points` follows the one run there is; a move the run cannot make is a `replay refused` error naming it — [Running one witness again](../guide/06-behavior.md#running-one-witness-again)). Applies to runs started from then on — `%action`, `%state`, `%analysis`; a calc's body performs nothing, so `%calc` has no choice to make — while a debugging session already under way keeps the policy it started with; every choice point a run reaches is reported and the `took …` of each `choice` line is what the policy took. A spelling naming no policy (an unknown name, `seed` or `seed:` without a number, `seed:-1`, `seed:abc`, a malformed `explore:` option, `replay:` without a readable file of choice lines, one that is empty or has a line spelling no choice) is refused and the policy is left as it was. `explore[:runs=N,depth=D]` is refused at the prompt too, as a typed error saying why: it replays a behavior from the start once per linearization, which `%action` and `%state`, stepping one run, cannot do — run `sysml -schedule explore -action <name>` (or `-state`, `-analysis`, `-calc`) for the outcome table ([Exploring every linearization](cli.md#exploring-every-linearization)), or send a request with that `schedule` over the wire |
| `%strict [on\|off]` | Show or set strict conformance: report notation no SysML v2 production admits as an error, and reprint the session's diagnostics under the new mode ([Strict conformance](../guide/03-command-line.md#strict-conformance)) |
| `%budget` | Show the five bounds one run may spend, each with the variable that raises it |
| `%jobs [<n>]` | Show or set how many runs of one check asked from then on may go concurrently — the linearizations a check explores under `%schedule explore`, the engines `%engine all` consults — the rows of a `%sweep` or `%samples` — each on a worker of its own over the session's model — and how many files of one `%load` are parsed and validated at once; `OPENSYSML_JOBS`, else one per CPU the memory available allows, until set. The result of a check is the same at any count. The count bounds a plan's runs, not the session: the held context, its objects and a debugging session under way are untouched by setting it. A value that is not a positive integer is refused and the count left as it was ([Running in parallel](cli.md#running-in-parallel)) |
| `%engines [probe]` | List the analysis engines of the build in name order — the kind of each, the protocol it is spoken by, the authority it carries, the question kinds it answers and its status (`ready`, `ready (z3 at …)` for one whose process was found, `unavailable: <why>`), then one line per manifest entry naming its file and command — as the CLI's [`-engines`](cli.md#analysis-engines) does, starting nothing. `%engines probe` also starts each [external engine](external-engines.md) once, checks its `describe` against its manifest entry field by field and reports the outcome as its status, as `-engines -probe` does; any other argument is refused |
| `%engine [<name>\|auto\|all]` | Show or set the analysis engine every question asked from then on — `%constraint`, `%requirement`, `%satisfy`, `%validate`, `%calc`, `%analysis`, `%sweep`, `%samples`, `%check` and the other solver commands — is put to. `auto` (the default) picks the engine of highest authority covering the question and advances past one that refuses or answers *not covered*; a name puts it to that engine alone, whose refusal is then the verdict; `all` puts it to every covering engine, one after another in name order, and composes their answers, naming a disagreement in the interpreter's favor. Every verdict is followed by a `standing:` line — the claim, the strength of the evidence (*not covered*, *observed*, *witnessed*, *bounded*, *proved*) and what earned it — and under `all` each engine's part. A name no engine is registered under is refused and the selection left as it was. `explore` is refused at the prompt as `%schedule explore` is, since the debuggers step one run; the `%action` and `%state` debuggers keep the schedule `%schedule` set whatever the engine ([Analysis engines](cli.md#analysis-engines)). `%engine check` is the one selection that changes what `%action` does by itself: it puts the action to the `check` engine, which searches every schedule for a violation, a deadlock, a failure or a divergence and prints the verdict, instead of starting a debugging session; `%engine all` does the same, the exploration beside the checker, once a `%check-*` setting is made ([Checking every schedule](#checking-every-schedule-of-an-action-or-a-state-machine)) |
| `%tool <case\|action>[(<args>)] [<object>]` | Show what the external tool a case's or action's `ToolExecution` names would be given — manifest, executable, argv, environment, working directory, standard input, input file and reply mapping — with the model's current values and the invocation's arguments bound, without starting the process, then discards everything the run did — the session is as the preview found it — as `-tool-dry-run` does ([External tools](external-engines.md)). A run reaching no `ToolExecution`-annotated action reports that; a manifest fault, an unregistered tool or an input the call does not send reports the typed error the real run would fail with. Refused under an exploring schedule, which runs many linearizations while a preview shows one run's first call |
| `%check-property [<name>...\|off]` | Show or set the constraints and requirements the `check` engine evaluates at every stable state of a checked action, on its performing object where there is one; `off` (the default) names none |
| `%check-diverge [<feature>...\|off]` | Show or set the features whose final values are compared across schedules, which makes the checked action's question one of *sensitivity*, answered by the `check` engine's divergence search or the `smt` engine's two-copy query, whichever `%engine` names, and by both under `%engine all` — `x` for the action's attribute, `step.out` for an output of a node it performs, `this.level` for the performing object's, a name nothing holds refused; `off` (the default) names none, and the `check` engine then compares every attribute of the action and of its performing object (an action run without one on its own attributes only). The CLI's [`-check-diverge`](cli.md#deciding-whether-the-schedule-decides-a-feature) |
| `%check-input [<feature>...\|off]` | Show or set the features of a checked action the `smt` engine leaves free in their declared type's domain although the model binds them — a default, a value the performing object holds; `off` (the default) frees only the inputs the model leaves unbound and pins every bound one at its value. A name that is not a feature the action reads is refused naming it when the action is checked. The CLI's [`-check-input`](cli.md#deciding-a-property-over-the-inputs) |
| `%check-assume [<name>...\|off]` | Show or set the constraints and requirements the `smt` engine asserts over the initial state of a checked action, so its claim ranges over the inputs they admit; `off` (the default) assumes none. A set no initial state satisfies is reported *not covered*, never *proved*. The CLI's [`-check-assume`](cli.md#deciding-a-property-over-the-inputs) |
| `%check-witness [<dir>\|off]` | Show or set the directory the `check` and `smt` engines write a witness file into for each violation and each divergent value, created if absent; `off` (the default) writes none, and the verdict names each divergent value and violation without a path. A witness of the `smt` engine's opens with the input values the solver chose, one `input <feature> = <value>` line each, ahead of the choice lines |
| `%check-bounds [depth=<n>] [states=<n>] [unroll=<n>] [timeout=<duration>] \| off` | Show or set the bounds the `check` and `smt` engines search within: `depth` is the most moves of one schedule (default 10 000 under `check`, 40 under `smt`, where it is the moves the action is unrolled to), `states` the most distinct states (default 1 000 000), `unroll` the most iterations of one loop the `smt` engine unrolls (default 4), `timeout` the wall clock the check may run for and the time each of the `smt` engine's solver queries may take in place of `OPENSYSML_SMT_TIMEOUT` (unbounded by default, the queries at `OPENSYSML_SMT_TIMEOUT`); each takes a positive integer or a duration such as `30s` (a zero or a negative one is refused and the bounds left as they were), the ones not named keep their values, and `off` restores every default. The CLI's [`-check-depth`, `-check-states`, `-check-unroll`, `-check-timeout`](cli.md#command-reference) |
| `%replay <witness>` | Install the schedule a witness file fixes, as `%schedule replay:<file>` does, so the next `%action` or `%state` starts the run the witness records — its `input` lines pinned before the run starts — and `%step`/`%continue` step it, each choice taken as the witness took it; the debugger refuses where a run departs from its witness, and an input line naming a feature the action does not have is refused naming it. A file that is not a witness is refused and the schedule left as it was |
| **Library Discovery** | |
| `%search <substring>` | List the declared and library symbols whose qualified name contains the substring, with the kind of each |
| `%builtins` | List the library functions the runtime implements directly (`sqrt`, `abs`, `max`, `floor`, `x->isEmpty()`, `x->sum()` …), each with the package an `import` must name for its bare name to resolve; the qualified name (`RealFunctions::sqrt(2.0)`) resolves anywhere |
| `%view <name>` | Show what a view exposes: its own `expose` relationships plus the protected ones of the views it specializes, the views nested in it (each with its own exposed set), and its conformance to every viewpoint it satisfies. Conformance is a verdict of `conforms`, `violated` or `unevaluable` per viewpoint and per framed concern, with the reason, the exposed element a concern's condition failed for, and `(from <view>)` where the `satisfy` is inherited. Asking about an element that is not a view says so |
| `%render <name> [form [palette] [style]]` | Render a view's exposed set in the kind its `render` member states: a containment tree with nested views as subtrees, an interconnection diagram of the exposed parts and the connections between them, a state machine's states and transitions, an action's nodes and successions, or a table of the exposed elements and what they declare. A view with no `render` member renders as a tree. Output is indented text by default, or the machine-readable form of the kind: a [Mermaid](#rendering-a-view) diagram with `mermaid`, a Markdown table with `markdown`; `dot` writes a graph-shaped kind as Graphviz DOT instead of Mermaid, in the Pilot visualizer's Standard B&W style, `plantuml` writes it — a sequence included — as PlantUML in the same style, and `dot <palette>` or `plantuml <palette>` fills the nodes by keyword family from `okabe-ito`, `tol-bright`, `tol-muted`, `tol-light`, `brewer-set2`, `brewer-dark2`, `viridis` or `cividis`; an unknown palette is refused with the names there are; `dot [palette] pilot` or `dot [palette] cameo` names the drawing style, the Pilot look (the default) or Cameo Systems Modeler's, and an unknown style is refused with the two there are. Asking for a form the kind cannot be written in tells you which form it uses. Read-only: it creates no object and leaves a `%action`/`%state` debugging session running. A view that exposes nothing renders empty and says so; a rendering kind this build does not produce is reported by kind and view rather than rendered as something else; an element the rendering cannot represent is reported, not dropped |
| **Instantiation & Inspection** | |
| `%instantiate <name>` | Create an object of a part definition and start the behaviors its type exhibits or performs. Each object runs its own machine, initialized after its feature values are built and run until it is quiescent. A second `%instantiate` of the same name creates a new object, and the name then refers to that one. A later submission keeps the object's identity but restarts its behaviors from their initial states, and says so |
| `%features <object> [all\|depth <n>] [json]` | Show what an object holds for each feature of its type. The object is named, addressed by id, or reached by a path: `%features car`, `%features #3`, `%features car.fl.hub`, `%features car.wheels[2]`. A feature with no value reads `<unset>`. States and actions hold no value, so they are listed after the values under a `Behaviors:` heading with what the object is doing with each: the current active state of a machine it exhibits (the state `%current` reports), the execution state of an action it performs, `not running` for a state or action it neither exhibits nor performs, or, for a named transition, the step it declares (`toggle: transition, modes.closed → modes.opened`). A behavior a redefinition renamed (`exhibit state fancyModes :>> modes`) is one execution under two names, and both rows report it. The values a running behavior owns — the attributes of the machine's own occurrence, an action's parameters and outputs — are listed under its row (`modes: exhibited state machine, current state running` followed by `count = 1`), apart from the performer's own values, and are bounded like any nested object. Reading a feature value builds the objects it holds, so the listing is bounded by default — 200 lines, nesting 8 deep — and a listing cut short says which form shows the rest. `all` lifts both bounds and reads the whole tree out; `depth <n>` bounds nesting at `n` levels and lifts the size bound, naming what it did not expand (`machine : Machine (not expanded: depth 1)`). `json` writes the object and everything reachable from it as one document in the shape the API's `Instantiate` returns (`instance`, `instances`, `diagnostics`), bounded by default at 1000 objects, with a graph cut short reported as a `warning` diagnostic. `all`/`depth` and `json` combine (`%features ctx all json`); `all` and `depth` together, a missing or negative depth, and an unknown word are errors naming the usage |
| `%instances` | List all created objects: the named ones, and the ones a second `%instantiate` of their name displaced, which stay reachable by id (`#3 (ID: 3, displaced from Demo::car)`) |
| `%eval <expr>` | Evaluate expression, in the last namespace the session declared; a library function is reached by its bare name only where that namespace imports its package, as the checker resolves it, and by its qualified name anywhere. The read is model-level, over what the declarations state: a feature the model leaves open — one with no value, or one whose count `[1..*]`/`[0..2]` the model does not fix — is the value `<undetermined>`, as is any expression whose answer depends on it, while what the model fixes still answers (`(u > 3) and false` is `false`, `size(slots)` of a `part slots[3]` is `3`). `<undetermined>` is a value, not an error; see `%eval in` for the object-level reading |
| `%eval in <name> : <expr>` | Evaluate expression in the named element's own namespace, or, when the name is an [object reference](#object-references) (`car`, `#3`, `car.fl`), on that object, so that a feature reads the value it holds after its behaviors ran (`%eval in #1 : recv.got`, `%eval in ctx.recv : got`). In the declaration's own namespace the read is model-level: a feature the declarations give no value to — a multi-valued `part wheels : Wheel[4]` or an attribute with no default, and a chain through one such as `wheels.radius` — reads `<undetermined>`, and so does an expression over it (`unsetMass + 1`) unless a constant operand fixes the answer (`(unsetMass > 1) and false` is `false`); a feature whose count the model leaves open (`[1..*]`, `[0..2]`) has an `<undetermined>` `size`, while what its bounds fix answers (`notEmpty` of a `[1..*]` is `true`). On an object the same feature reads `<unset>`, an expression over it fails naming the feature that has no value, and multiplicity minimums are materialized. `unresolved reference` is reserved for a name nothing declares. The separator is the first `:` outside a quoted name that is not part of a `::`, so `%eval in Demo : Vehicle::mass` works |
| **Behavioral Execution** | |
| `%calc <name> [args...]` | Invoke calculation with arguments |
| `%analysis <name>[(<args>)] [<object>]` | Run an analysis or verification case — a calculation performed as an action — and print its `out` and `return` values with their units, then the verdict of its `objective` and of each `assert constraint` in its body: `satisfied`, `not satisfied` with the violated condition, or `undecided` with the reason the condition could not be evaluated. An objective typed by a requirement def binds the def's subject as a requirement usage does (`subject = ship;`, `subject s = ship;` or `subject :>> s = ship;`), reading the case's subject, parameters and steps' outputs; one binding none checks the case's result, the library's default for it (`Cases::Case::obj`), and is `undecided` naming the type when that result is not of the subject's type. Arguments in parentheses bind the case's `in` parameters, positionally (`%analysis An::Case(3.0)`) or by name (`%analysis An::Case(limit = 3.0)`), evaluated at the prompt like `%calc`'s; an [object reference](#object-references) after them is the case's `subject` (`%analysis An::CostAnalysis An::barge`). A usage that binds its subject (`subject s = ship;`) needs no object; a definition, or a usage that binds none, is refused by name without one, as `%requirement` refuses an unbound subject. A usage nested in a part runs as a feature of the object the session holds for that part (`%instantiate An::holder`, then `%analysis An::Holder::inner`). The body's `action` steps, sequenced by `then` or by declaration order, run as an action does, later steps reading earlier steps' outputs; a step that fails, a body that deadlocks or exhausts the step budget, a case that runs itself, and an `in` parameter with no argument and no default are errors naming the case; a case recursing without bound through a nested `analysis` step reports the depth limit on one line, its repeated frames collapsed to a count as `%calc`'s are. `%calc` refuses an analysis case and says to run it this way. A `verification def` or `verification` usage runs the same way and reports in addition the `VerdictKind` its body produced: `pass`/`fail` from the library's own `VerificationCases::PassIf` calculation, a `VerdictKind` literal the body bound, `inconclusive` for a body producing no verdict value, or `error` with the reason a body's run could not be carried out; each nested verification step is reported on its own line, marked `(subcase)`, the library stating no roll-up. A `TradeStudies::TradeStudy` runs the same way — the library's own expressions apply the case's `evaluationFunction` to each alternative the subject lists, in subject order, and `selectOne` returns the first scoring the objective's `best` — and the report adds each evaluation the run made of the case's own calc as a value, with `[selected]` on the alternative returned and `[tied]` on a later one scoring the same; an evaluation that fails is listed with its error and leaves the objective `undecided`, a subject listing no alternative or redeclared `[1]` and bound to several is a `multiplicity violation` ([Trade studies](../guide/06-behavior.md#trade-studies)) |
| `%record <name>[(<args>)] [<object>] [into <package>]` | Run an analysis case as `%analysis` does — the same verdict lines and the same bindings — and record the run into the model as `AnalysisRecords` elements: a record definition named for the case (`TimedRun` for `Demo::timed`) specializing `AnalysisRecords::AnalysisRun`, in a `Records` package beside the case's enclosing package or the one `into` names, and one part per run carrying a redefinition of each input bound and output produced, `caseName`, `kind`, `iteration`, a `ref` to the subject, `VerdictRecord`/`EvaluationRecord` parts for the verdicts and evaluations it made, and `@AnalysisRecords::RecordedRun` provenance metadata (`runAt`, `tool`, `command`, `kind`). The last line names what was recorded (`recorded Records::timed_run1 (Records::TimedRun)`); recording again of the same case numbers the part on (`timed_run2`), including after a `%save` and reload. The record submission is atomic: a run that fails, a record definition that does not specialize `AnalysisRecords::AnalysisRun`, a declared feature that collides with a reserved one, or a merge that would drop or produce diagnostics leaves the session's model untouched and reports the error. The records are ordinary elements — `%save` writes them with the model, and a `%run-query`/`%render-document` reads them by `WhereMetadata('metadata' = "AnalysisRecords::RecordedRun")`, `WhereFeature` and `Project`. Same recording as the CLI's [`-record-run`](cli.md#recording-analysis-runs); sweeps and Monte Carlo samples are recorded through `-record-run` with `-sweep`/`-runs`. See [Recording analysis runs](../manual/recording-analysis-runs.md) |
| `%run-query <name> [<p>=<expr>...]` | Execute a document query (a `calc def` specializing `DocumentQueries::Query`) and print its rows and projected cells. A projection lists declared property names and may add computed columns: `Column(name = "<column>", expression = <expr>)` entries evaluated once per row over the row element's features, with arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), string concatenation and `??` defaults for absent values. A column expression that fails (including a reference that resolves to no value and has no `??` default) fails the query with a typed error rather than producing an empty cell. A `RelatedColumn(name, relationshipKind, direction, maxDepth, aggregate = "list")` entry derives a column from the elements `RelatedElements` reaches from each row — the elements themselves as a multi-valued cell (`[a, b]`, `(none)` when there are none), their `"count"` or `"any"` of them — and `WhereFeature`/`OrderBy` read it by name ([Traceability matrix](../manual/query-cookbook.md#traceability-matrix)). Each binding is written as `<parameter>=<expression>`; a name binds the object the session holds under it while it holds one (`car` after `%instantiate car`; `#2` and `car.wheels[2]` bind an object by id and by path), else the element it refers to, and anything else is evaluated as an expression. Over an object the operations read what the session holds: its parts as `OwnedElements`/`Descendants`, the values it holds now as its properties, and `Objects(type = "<type>")` enumerates every object held that is of the type ([Objects the session holds](../manual/query-cookbook.md#objects-the-session-holds)). `Verdicts(source = <rows>)` checks the object behind each row as `%validate` does — the held object, or the element's declared object — and answers one verdict row per assertion about it and the objects it holds, printed as `<assertion> on <path>: <verdict>`; `Project`, `WhereFeature` and `OrderBy` read its `path`, `kind`, `verdict`, `condition`, `reason` and `verification` beside the assertion's own properties ([Which constraints and requirements hold](../manual/query-cookbook.md#which-constraints-and-requirements-hold)). `States(source = <rows>)` answers the state each object's machine is in now, one row per active leaf (`<object>.<machine> in <statePath>`, with `machine`, `name`, `statePath`, `region` and `enclosing`), `InState(name = "<state>")` the held objects in that state, and `Events(source, kind, since, before)` the trace the session records — `%trace on` first, or the query is refused — as rows (`t=<instant> <object>.<machine>: <text>`, with `kind`, `time`, `state`, `from`, `to`, `target`, `event`, `payload`, `alternatives`, `taken`), `[since, before)` inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end ([Where the objects stand and what they did](../manual/query-cookbook.md#where-the-objects-stand-and-what-they-did)). A parameter left unbound takes its declared default (`in root : Element = telescope;`, `in pattern : String default "m";`) under the same rule: a name binds the element it refers to, anything else is evaluated once in the query that declared it, and a redefining parameter's default replaces the inherited one. Named query invocation and relationship traversal (`RelatedElements` over specialization, subsetting, redefinition, typing, connection, allocation, satisfaction and verification edges, outgoing or incoming) are supported. See the [query cookbook](../manual/query-cookbook.md) |
| `%render-document <name> [mermaid\|dot\|plantuml [pilot\|cameo]]` | Compile a document definition (a `part def` specializing `DocumentQueries::Document`), run its queries against the model — and against the objects the session holds, a parameter bound to a usage's name binding the object held under it while one is — and print the rendered Markdown. A document binds its queries' parameters in the model, so the name is the whole invocation apart from the optional diagram form: `mermaid`, `dot` or `plantuml`, the form every graph-shaped diagram block of the document is written in — omitted, a view some `DiagramLayout::Layout` or `Route` positions is `dot`, drawn by Graphviz where it states (inline SVG when `dot` is installed, Mermaid under a visible notice naming the missing tool when it is not), and every other graph-shaped view is `mermaid` — and after it the optional drawing style the `dot` blocks are drawn in, `pilot` (the default) or `cameo`. The output is deterministic CommonMark: the title and sections as ATX headings; paragraphs from text runs (`Span` runs with a `plain`/`emphasis`/`strong`/`code` style, `Link` runs to a URL, `Ref` runs linking to another content block's anchor, and query-produced values styled through nested `SpanColumn`/`LinkColumn` column runs); GitHub-flavored pipe tables with the projected column names (one subtable per group value when the table has a `groupBy` column); bullet and numbered lists; diagram blocks as fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks rendered through the view engine (` ```dot ` blocks of Graphviz DOT with the `dot` form, ` ```plantuml ` blocks with `plantuml`; a table-kind view as a pipe table whichever form), with an optional caption and `TB`/`LR`/`RL`/`BT` flow direction. Markdown metacharacters in content are escaped. Markdown is the only form the REPL writes; the CLI's `-doc-form html` renders the same document tree as semantic HTML ([Rendering a document as HTML](cli.md#rendering-a-document-as-html)) and `-doc-form pdf` converts the Markdown to PDF ([Rendering a document as PDF](cli.md#rendering-a-document-as-pdf)). See the [document generation manual](../manual/README.md) |
| `%sweep <name>[(<args>)] [<object>] <parameter>=<from>..<to>[:<step>] ...` | Run an analysis case or a calc once per value of a range and print the runs as a table: one row per run, carrying the values bound for it, the run's `out`/`return` values, the verdict of its `objective` where it has one, and the wall time of that run. The invocation is written as `%analysis`/`%calc` writes it — arguments in parentheses, an [object reference](#object-references) after them as the case's `subject` — and each range that follows names a parameter the case declares and the arguments do not bind. Endpoints and step are expressions evaluated at the prompt, units included (`speed=0.0 [SI::'m/s']..10.0 [SI::'m/s']:2.0 [SI::'m/s']`), converted to the unit `<from>` carries; `<to>` is included where the step lands on it. The values are produced in the parameter's declared type, not the literals' — a `Real` or `Rational` parameter swept over `1..4:1` is bound to `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`, `4.0` and shown so; an `Integer`, `Natural` or `Positive` parameter swept over `1.0..3.0:1.0` to `1`, `2`, `3`, and an endpoint or step of it that is no Integer, or below what a `Natural` or `Positive` holds, is refused naming the parameter and its type before any run; an `attribute def` specializing a scalar takes that scalar's values; a quantity-typed parameter is typed through its `num` (`Number` in the library, so its magnitudes are read as written; `Integer` where a model redefines it so, a `Natural` or `Positive` one refusing a magnitude below what it holds and one holding no number refusing the range) and takes the unit `<from>` carries; a `Number`-typed parameter and one declaring no type take the range as written — Integers between Integer literals, reals otherwise — and an untyped one is noted under the table; a `Boolean`, `String`, enumeration or non-scalar parameter refuses a range naming its type. A range between whole numbers with no `:<step>` steps by one, up or down as its endpoints direct; a range with a fractional endpoint and no step is refused. A range read as reals takes an Integer endpoint or step only where a Real holds it without rounding, and steps only where the reals tell its rows apart, so a range whose rows would repeat one value is refused rather than run. Several ranges run their cartesian product, the first written varying slowest, and rows come out in that order. A run that fails is a row numbering its typed error, printed in full under the table, rather than an abort of the table. A parameter whose name needs the quotes of an unrestricted name is swept under that name, quotes included (`'launch mass'=1..3`). A step of zero, a step whose sign never reaches `<to>`, an endpoint that is no number or is not finite, incompatible units, an undeclared parameter, the case's subject, one the arguments already bind — by name or by holding the position it is bound from — and a plan asking for more runs than `OPENSYSML_MAX_SWEEP_RUNS` allows are errors naming what was asked for. A trade study's rows carry an `evaluations` column, each run's evaluations of its alternatives with the one selected marked, a failed row keeping the ones it made. Each row is a run in a context of its own — the subject and the `self` of a nested case instantiated there, the arguments evaluated once at the prompt (a held feature a run wrote reads as written) and their values carried in, an argument naming a held object bound to the object the row makes for it — so no row sees another's writes; rows run `%jobs` at a time, and the table is in range order whatever order they finish in, the `time` column alone varying with the count. A sweep on an object the session holds runs each row on an object of its own that is the held object as the sweep found it, and leaves the held object as it was: a fresh object of the held object's declaration (one reached through a feature of another, `fleet.flagship`, on the like of `fleet` walked to its `flagship`) while the object is as the declaration made it, the behaviors its type exhibits or performs still as their start left them — as one fresh from `%instantiate` is; otherwise — named by `#<id>`, a feature of it written by a run, a signal sent to it, its state machine moved or its performed action past a wait — a copy from one image of the held object and what it holds, taken as the sweep begins and made in each row's context under the same identities, executors and posted signals included. One destroyed, or in a state no copy carries (a body paused mid-statement, a debugger inside a step), is refused naming the reason, never swept on shared state; an argument naming a held object binds the row's copy of it, and is refused naming the argument when no copy can be made or its value is bound to the run that made it. Same tables as the CLI's [`-sweep`](cli.md#sweeping-a-parameter) |
| `%samples <n> <seed> <name>[(<args>)] [<object>] <parameter>=<from>..<to> ...` | Draw `n` values for each range instead of running every value of it, uniformly over `[<from>, <to>]` for a parameter taking Integers and `[<from>, <to>)` for one taking reals — the parameter's type decides, so an `Integer` parameter sampled over `1.0..4.0` draws the Integers 1 to 4 and a `Real` parameter sampled over `1..4` draws reals in `[1, 4)` — and print the rows in draw order with the seed in the table header. The generator is `math/rand/v2`'s `PCG` seeded from `<seed>`, so the same seed draws the same values on every platform; a sampled range needs no step and stating one is refused. Sampling is uniform because the bundled standard library states no probability distribution — a range written as a named distribution (`n=normal(1.0, 0.2)`) is an error naming what is missing rather than an approximation |
| `%runs <n> [<seed>] <action> [<observable>...]` | Run an action to completion `n` times, each run on a fresh context with a model seed of its own derived from `<seed>` and the run number — so the same seed makes the same table on every platform — and print the runs as a table: one row per run, numbered, with each named observable, a feature the action holds or `clock` for the simulation time the run completed at (the name is the clock's, so a feature called `clock` is not reported); without observables every feature the action holds and the clock. Below the table each numeric observable is summarised over the runs that completed — min, mean, max, the nearest-rank p50 and p90, and a histogram — and a non-numeric one is counted by value. The model seed is what a `@Probability`-weighted decision and a `RandomFunctions` call draw from ([When a model states its own odds](../guide/06-behavior.md#when-a-model-states-its-own-odds)); `%schedule` stays the second knob and resolves the concurrency choices, which carry no probability, in every run alike, `replay:<file>` being one run and refused. The runs are the rows of a `%sweep` plan with no range, `%jobs` at a time, bounded by `OPENSYSML_MAX_SWEEP_RUNS`, a failed run a numbered row with its error under the table; a part or item the action holds exactly one of is observed through its attributes (`target.total`). The seed is left out under `%draws min`, `%draws max` or `%draws average`, whose runs draw nothing at random (`%runs 20 Sys::align clock`), or when `%seed` is set, which the runs then derive their seeds from; under `%draws random` with no `%seed` a `%runs <n> <action>` is refused naming the seed and `%draws`; an observable the action does not hold, one named twice, and a count or seed that is not a whole number are refused. Same tables as the CLI's [`-runs`](cli.md#running-an-action-many-times) |
| `%seed [<n>\|off]` | Show or set the model seed the runs started from then on — `%action`, `%state`, `%analysis`, a `%sweep` row — draw their modeled randomness from, whatever `%schedule` is: the branch a `@Probability`-weighted decision takes, the value a `RandomFunctions` call returns. `off` (the initial state) leaves it to the schedule: under `%schedule seed:<n>` the model draws from `n` on a stream of its own, and under any other schedule a run that must draw a value is refused naming the call and this command, while a weighted decision takes its most probable branch. The seed is applied to the context the session holds as well, so a debugging session started after `%seed 7` draws from `7`; a value that is not a non-negative whole number or `off` is refused and the seed left as it was |
| `%draws [<policy>]` | Show or set how the runs started from then on — `%action`, `%state`, `%analysis`, a `%runs` row, the debugger's session — resolve the draws of `RandomFunctions` (`uniform`, `uniformInteger`, `triangular`, `normal`): `random` (the initial state) draws each call from the model seed; `min`, `max` and `average` resolve each call to the least, greatest or mean value of its distribution instead and need no seed (`min` and `max` read a bounded call's interval closed at both ends, so `uniform(lo, hi)` is `lo` or `hi`), so a run whose only randomness is its durations completes deterministically; `normal` with a positive deviation has no least or greatest value, so a run that calls it under `min` or `max` stops with an error naming the call and the policy (`normal(m, 0)` is `m` under every policy, `random` included, and needs no seed). Weighted decisions are not durations: they draw from the seed under every policy, and unseeded take their most probable branch. The policy is applied to the context the session holds as well, so a debugging session started after `%draws max` draws at the max, while a run under way — a paused debugging session included — keeps the policy it started under; a spelling that is none of the four, or more than one word, is refused and the policy left as it was. Every witness `%check-witness` writes records a fixed policy as `draws by <policy>`, which `%replay` runs under. Same policy as the CLI's [`-draws`](cli.md#running-an-action-many-times) |
| `%clock-step [<seconds>]` | Show or set the step the clock of the runs started from then on — `%action`, `%state`, `%analysis`, a `%runs` row, the debugger's session — ticks by, as a simulation tool's fixed-step clock does: a wait comes due at the first multiple of the step not before the instant it ends, so under `%clock-step 1` a wait of `2.3 [s]` set at `t=0` comes due at `t=3.0`; `0` (the initial state) is a continuous clock, on which a wait comes due exactly when it ends. The step is applied to the context the session holds as well, so a debugging session's waits set after `%clock-step 10` come due on tens, while a wait already queued keeps its instant; a step that is no finite, non-negative number, or more than one word, is refused and the step left as it was. Every witness `%check-witness` writes for a stepped run records it as `clock steps by <seconds>`, which `%replay` runs on. Same step as the CLI's [`-clock-step`](cli.md#running-an-action-many-times) |
| `%constraint <name>` | Evaluate constraint (assert/assume) |
| `%invoke <object> <op> [<p>=<expr>]` | Invoke an operation of an object's type (an action it owns), performed by that object, given as an [object reference](#object-references) (`%invoke car start`, `%invoke #3 start`, `%invoke car.engine start`), with arguments given as a positional list or as `<parameter>=<expression>` pairs; mixing named and positional forms is refused. Assignments in the body write that object's feature values; declared outputs are reported. An operation given as a `calc` or `constraint` is not supported through this command |
| `%requirement <name>` | Evaluate requirement (subject/assume/require/actor), reporting beside its verdict the `VerdictKind` the body of every verification case verifying it produced |
| `%satisfy [name]` | Evaluate satisfaction assertions of the model, or of one element, reporting beside each verdict the `VerdictKind` the body of every verification case verifying the requirement produced |
| `%validate <object>` | Evaluate every assertion about an object the session holds and the objects it holds in turn, given as an [object reference](#object-references) (`%validate car`, `%validate #3`, `%validate car.wheels[2]`): each `assert constraint` the carrier's type declares or inherits, each requirement usage it carries, and each `satisfy` assertion whose subject is in the tree — one verdict per assertion per object, root first and then each held object as the walk reaches it, each naming its object by the path from the one validated (`Demo::car.wheels[2]`, indexes counted from 1), then one verdict about the object as a whole with its `standing:`. An assertion that could not be evaluated is `?` undecided with the reason, not `✗`; the object is valid only when every assertion holds and every held object was reached, so an undecided assertion, or a walk cut short by an object graph without end, leaves it `not shown valid` rather than valid, and an object no assertion is about `states no assertion to validate` and is not shown valid either. A constraint declared without `assert` is not swept; `%constraint` checks it by name. Verifying verification cases are reported beside a requirement's verdict as `%requirement` reports them. Refuses a name no object is held under (`no instance of "car" (use %instantiate first)`) |
| `%check <name>` | **Experimental.** Ask an external SMT solver whether a constraint, requirement or satisfaction assertion *can* be satisfied, and on `sat` print an assignment. Reports `sat`, `unsat` or `unknown`, kept distinct. Needs `z3` or `cvc5` on `PATH` (or `OPENSYSML_SMT`; see [installing a solver](../guide/01-install.md#installing-a-solver-optional)) and reports an error rather than a verdict when none is installed. Satisfiability is not evaluation: use `%constraint`/`%satisfy` to find out what holds for an object |
| `%explain <name>` | **Experimental.** When `%check` answers `unsat`, ask the solver *which* conditions conflict. Prints an unsat core, reduced to a minimal one, as the role, the condition as written, the declaring element and `file:line:col`, in the query's order. A declared domain (a `Natural` being non-negative) or a division well-definedness guard can be one of the conflicting conditions. On `sat` there is no conflict to explain and `%check` gives the assignment; on `unknown` no explanation is available. Same solver requirements as `%check` ([installing a solver](../guide/01-install.md#installing-a-solver-optional)); `OPENSYSML_SMT_CORE_BUDGET` bounds the reduction |
| `%solve <name>` | **Experimental.** Ask the solver for values that satisfy a constraint, requirement or satisfaction assertion, keeping what is already fixed: the values an object holds, or failing that the ones the model declares, stay fixed and the rest are synthesised. Prints what was fixed (and by what), the values chosen, and a reminder that they are *one* witness of possibly many. `unsat` here means no values exist that are consistent with what is fixed, and names the fixed values that conflict. Same solver requirements as `%check` |
| `%configure <name> [<variation>=<variant>...] [all [<count>]]` | **Experimental.** Ask which variants a constraint, requirement or satisfaction assertion permits. With no argument, one consistent selection is synthesised. With `<variation>=<variant>`, the chosen selection is checked and the conflict is named when it is not consistent. With `all`, the consistent selections are enumerated up to `OPENSYSML_SMT_MAX_CONFIGURATIONS` (`all <count>` for a smaller bound), and the report says whether the list is complete or was cut short, either at the bound or because the solver stopped deciding or ran out of time; the selections found so far are still reported. An element that reads no variation point is an error pointing at `%check`. Same solver requirements as `%check` |
| `%optimize <name>` | **Experimental.** Ask the solver for the best values an `analysis def` (or an analysis usage) admits. Each `objective` is improved as the trade-study definition typing it says (`TradeStudies::MinimizeObjective` or `MaximizeObjective`), over the value its redefinition of the library's `eval` calculation returns (`subject :>> selectedAlternative; in calc :>> eval { expression }`), within the conditions the case requires or assumes and the ones the objective states itself. An objective that instead gives the library's bound `best` a value of its own (`attribute :>> best = expression;`, the spelling earlier releases read) is a validation error, and `%optimize` refuses it pointing at the `eval` spelling. Several objectives are improved lexicographically in declaration order, inherited ones first; an objective restating an inherited one (by name or `:>>`) stands in its place with the value stated there. Prints each optimum with its declared unit and the assignment that attains it. An objective that improves without limit, or a bound no assignment attains, is reported as such and never as a number, and every optimum is verified before it is reported. **Needs `z3`**: optimization is a z3 extension, and a backend without it (cvc5) is an error rather than a plain satisfiability check presented as an optimum. Otherwise the same solver requirements as `%check`. `%optimize` answers a different question from running the case: it finds the best *values* the case's conditions admit over a continuous domain, where `%analysis` executes what the model says over the alternatives it lists. A `TradeStudies::TradeStudy` whose objective applies the case's `evaluationFunction` to listed alternatives is therefore refused, pointing at `%analysis`/`-analysis`/`RunAnalysis`, which evaluate every alternative and report the one selected ([Trade studies](../guide/06-behavior.md#trade-studies)) |
| **Action debugging** ([guide chapter 6](../guide/06-behavior.md)) | |
| `%action <name> [<object>]` | Start an action debugging session, optionally performed by an instantiated object, given as an [object reference](#object-references) (`%action tally car`, `%action tally #3`). Under `%engine check`, or `%engine all` with a `%check-*` setting made, the action is checked instead of stepped ([Checking every schedule](#checking-every-schedule-of-an-action-or-a-state-machine)) |
| `%step` | Advance one token step; a token waiting only on the clock (`accept after`, `accept at`) is not stepped, and the report names the `%advance` that would move it |
| `%continue` | Run the action to completion |
| `%tokens` | Show the active tokens |
| `%break <node>` | Set a breakpoint at a node |
| `%stop` | Stop the current debugging session |
| **State machine debugging** ([guide chapter 6](../guide/06-behavior.md)) | |
| `%state <name> [<object>]` | Debug the machine an object exhibits (`%state <object>` after `%instantiate` attaches to that object's own running machine, whether the object is named, `#3`, or `car.controller`), or start a state machine — named, or the object of one the session holds (`%state #2`, `%state monitor.modes`), which exhibits none and so runs afresh — optionally performed by an instantiated object, given as an [object reference](#object-references). `%state <machine> <object>` first looks at what the object already runs: naming a machine it exhibits — one that *is* or is *typed by* `<machine>` (`%state Rover::modes rover`) — attaches to that running machine too, with a note saying so, rather than performing it a second time against the same feature values, so the object never runs two of them; only a machine the object does not exhibit is started as a detached performance, and the report says that too. Naming an exhibited machine alone (`%state Rover::modes`, or its short name `modes`) attaches to the running machine of the one held object exhibiting it — the object `%instances` and `%features` show. Held objects are the ones the session has built: a nested part counts once something has reached it (`%features driver`), and `%state` builds none itself. When no held object exhibits it, or several do, `%state` refuses and names the objects (or, with none held, the types exhibiting it), so that you name one with `%state <object>` or `%state <machine> <object>`; it never guesses, and never performs a machine a type exhibits detached from any object. The machine is addressed by any binding on the way to its body — the exhibited usage, a usage it references, or the definition typing it — so `%state Blink` finds the object exhibiting `spare : Blink`. A machine no type exhibits (a `state def` alone) is started as a detached performance, as there is no object's performance of it to attach to. A definition the object exhibits as the body of several usages names no one machine, so `%state` refuses and names the exhibited usages to name instead. `%step`, `%advance`, `%current` and `%events` then drive that object's machine, and `%features` shows what it wrote. Under `%engine check`, or `%engine all` with a `%check-*` setting made, the machine is checked instead of stepped, its clock run until nothing is due ([Checking every schedule](#checking-every-schedule-of-an-action-or-a-state-machine)) |
| `%send <signal>[(<p>=<expr>, ...)] [to <object>]` | Send a signal to an object through the runtime's own message bus, as `send <signal>(...) to <object>` from an action would, for any behavior the object runs to take: a state machine it exhibits, or an action it performs (a top-level `perform`, or one nested in it) whose token is parked at a matching `accept`; the object is an [object reference](#object-references) (`to bulb`, `to #1`, `to rack.lamp`). `<signal>` is a definition the model declares (an `attribute def`, `item def` or other signal-like definition; qualified names allowed), or a bare name an active `accept` matches by name when no declaration types it. Each argument is written `<parameter>=<expression>` as for `%invoke`, evaluated at the prompt, and must name a feature the signal carries with a value that feature admits (its type and multiplicity, checked before anything is sent); a feature left out is left unset. Without `to`, the target is the object whose machine the current `%state` session is debugging, or failing that the object an `%action <name> <object>` session performs its action on behalf of (the very object it materialized); with no session, or an `%action` session on no object, the command says so rather than guessing. An object that runs no behavior at all is refused. The signal is refused, with each behavior's standing (the machine's current state, the accept the action is parked at or the state of its run), when no behavior of the object accepts it there, or when the guard of every transition it triggers is false — decided as the dispatch would decide it, the payload bound, so a guard that reads it is honoured; a guard that cannot be evaluated is an error. A signal the current state defers rather than accepts is sent and reported as deferred: the step dispatching it holds it (`%events` lists it as held) until the machine reaches a state that accepts it, when it is recalled and fires. A signal an active state's do behavior is parked at an `accept` for is sent too, though no transition fires on it, reported as `the do behavior of state <s> goes on from its accept`; the step dispatching it lets the behavior go on. A signal a performed action is parked at an `accept` for is sent and reported as `Accepted by performed action "main" waiting at accept g` (an accept in a nested action is placed: `accept h of inner`; an action whose parallel tokens are parked at several accepts for the signal is reported with all of them, `waiting at accept l and at accept r; the step dispatching it lets one of them take it`, as which one goes on is the step's scheduling to decide); the action goes on from the accept when the object's behaviors next run — at the next `%advance`, from any debugging session of the runtime, or the next `%step` or `%continue` of an `%action` session stepping that very execution; only a session drives the runtime, so the report ends with the one to use (`Use %advance <time> to dispatch it`), or, with none open, says to open a `%state` or `%action` session first (so does a session a declaration left running on the runtime of an earlier model: it neither hears the signal nor drives the object). Otherwise it is in flight (shown by `%events`) until `%step` or `%advance` dispatches it, and the transition it triggers fires as it would for a send from an action; should the state or the data a guard reads change before the dispatch, the step that drops the signal says so. An object running several behaviors is sent the signal as a whole: `%send` reports each machine that would fire on or defer it and each action that goes on from its accept, a machine whose guards would drop it leaves it in flight for a sibling that would not, and the report says when the machine being debugged is such a one |
| `%events` | Show the event queue and the signals in flight |
| `%current` | Show the current state and configuration |
| `%advance <time>` | Advance the runtime's simulation clock by `<time>` seconds (`SI::s`), running every state event, action token, change-condition poll and do behavior that comes due, in due order. The clock is the session's, not one debugger's: an `%action` parked at `accept after` and a `%state` machine both move, and the report covers each. A state's do behavior whose action body waits (`do action poll { action wait accept after 3 [SI::s]; then … }`) is parked on the clock too, listed under `Waiting on the clock` and resumed when its instant comes; a transition that leaves the state first ends it, its wait leaving the clock. Two executors due at the same instant run in the order the scheduling policy picks — the one started last first under the default `reverse` — and the pick is a choice point, as is which of two regions' do behaviors due together acts first in a round ([Choice points](../guide/06-behavior.md)). Under `%engine check` there is no run to advance: `%advance` searches the behavior last checked again, up to that instant as its horizon |

The five solving commands (`%check`, `%explain`, `%solve`, `%configure`, `%optimize`) follow the
design of the `ConstraintSolverService` in OpenMBEE's [HMF](https://github.com/hivecore-dev/hmf)
(Apache 2.0); see [Acknowledgements](../../README.md#acknowledgements). `%check` asks a solver
whether an assertion *can* be satisfied; it is not the `check` engine, which `%engine check`
selects and the next section describes.

## Checking every schedule of an action or a state machine

The `%action` and `%state` debuggers step one run under the schedule `%schedule` set; `%engine
check` puts the behavior to the explicit-state model checker instead, which searches every
schedule the library leaves open — an action's token orders and branches, a machine's
transitions, region orders and the events due together — and reports the first violation,
deadlock or failure it reaches or the features whose final value the schedule decides — the
CLI's [`-engine check`](cli.md#checking-every-schedule-of-an-action-or-a-state-machine), with
the same verdicts and the same bounds. Each violation's line ends `(probability <mass>)`: the
sum of the path probabilities of the search paths reaching it, `≥`-prefixed when the search was
bounded, revisited a state or its reduction left a move out. A machine is searched with its clock run until nothing
more is due; `%advance <time>` after it searches the same behavior again up to that horizon,
and the CLI's `-action` and `-state` with `-advance` (the session's `RunFor`) search the
behaviors named as one invocation on one clock, an action's wait and a machine's timer due
together being a choice the search draws. `%check-property`, `%check-diverge`, `%check-input`, `%check-assume`,
`%check-witness` and `%check-bounds` hold the settings the CLI's `-check-*` flags carry, each
shown with no argument and kept for the session, and `%replay` steps the run a witness records.
A check runs in contexts of its own, so the object it performs on is named as a run can build
it — a declaration to instantiate (`%state Rover::modes Rover::rover`) or a path from one into a
part it holds (`%state Comms::Ground::listen Comms::pair.ground`), the declaration instantiated
once per run for every path under it — not as an object the session holds: `%instantiate`'s
object, `#2` and a path from it are refused naming the rule, the CLI's [Objects an exploration
runs on](cli.md#objects-an-exploration-runs-on). An unknown usage in the path or an index a
single-valued usage takes none of is refused before the search; a part a run finds unbuilt is
that run's error.
Under `%engine all`, `%action` searches once any of them is set — the checker beside the
exploration, `states=<n>` being the one figure each bounds in its own unit — and steps again
once every one is `off`:

`%engine smt` puts the action to the symbolic engine instead, which
decides the `%check-property` constraints over every schedule and every value of the free
inputs with an SMT solver — the CLI's
[`-engine smt`](cli.md#deciding-a-property-over-the-inputs): `%check-input` frees a feature the
model binds, `%check-assume` narrows the initial states the claim ranges over, and a violation's
witness names the values the solver chose and replays through `%replay` with them pinned:

`%check-diverge` under `%engine smt` asks whether the schedule decides a feature — the CLI's
[`-check-diverge`](cli.md#deciding-whether-the-schedule-decides-a-feature): a *sensitive*
verdict names the two final values, the step at which the two schedules part and the move each
took there, and writes a witness per schedule, `-A` and `-B`, either of which `%replay` steps
under `%engine auto`; a feature every schedule ends alike is *holds*, *proved* when no schedule
was cut by the bounds and *bounded* otherwise:

```text

engine: smt
sysml> %check-witness witnesses
check-witness: witnesses
sysml> %check-diverge x
check-diverge: x
sysml> %action Debug::race
✗ Action Debug::race: sensitive: x ends as 1 or 2; the schedules part at step 3: step 3: 2@left first of 2@left, 3@right against step 3: 3@right first of 2@left, 3@right
  inputs: x = 0
  witness A: witnesses/Debug.race-x-A.witness
  witness B: witnesses/Debug.race-x-B.witness
  standing: sensitive (witnessed: witness of 1 choice replayed, inputs as written)

sysml> %engine auto

```

Each engine reads its own settings: `states=<n>` is the `check` engine's, `%check-input`,
`%check-assume` and `unroll=<n>` the `smt` engine's, and the rest — `%check-diverge` included —
both. A setting made that the engine selected alone does not read is refused when the action
is checked, naming the setting and the engine that reads it, rather than dropped; under
`%engine all` any `smt` setting, like a `%check-property`, puts the action to the `check` and
`smt` engines as a question of what holds.

A check leaves no debugging session behind — `%step` after it reports no active session — and
changes nothing about the debuggers: `%action` under any other engine (`all` included, until a
`%check-*` setting is made), `%step` and `%continue` step one run as before, `%schedule explore` and `%engine explore` are refused at the prompt as
they were, and a declaration unrelated to a running debugger still leaves it running. `%replay` under
`%engine check` says so: `%action` would search again, so it names `%engine auto` as the
selection under which the next `%action` steps the replayed run. A witness of behaviors checked
on one clock replays the same way: `%replay`, then `%action` and `%state` on the one object,
then `%advance` to the horizon, the due order taken as the witness took it.

## Object references

An object reference names one object the session holds. It is one of:

| Form | Denotes |
|------|---------|
| `car`, `Demo::car` | the object `%instantiate car` created, by the name it was created under (unqualified or qualified, quoted segments included) |
| `#3` | the object whose id `%instantiate` printed as `ID: 3`. Ids count up from 1 and never change: an object keeps its id when a later submission carries it over, and when a second `%instantiate` of its name creates a new object — the name then denotes the new one, and `#3` is how the old one is reached (`%instances` lists it as `#3 (ID: 3, displaced from Demo::car)`) |
| `car.fl`, `#3.fl`, `car.fl.hub` | a path from a named object or an id through the features that hold objects, one nested object per segment: parts, ports, connectors, and structured attributes (an attribute typed by an `attribute def` with attributes of its own, which `%features` shows as `Instance(ID: n)`). An attribute holding a plain value ends a path with an error. `.` and `::` are interchangeable in a path, so `car::fl` and `car.fl` are the same object. They differ only in how the root is found: a segment after `.` is always a feature of the object before it, while `::` may also continue the declared name, so the longest `::`-run naming an object the session holds is the root (`Demo::car::fl` is the object `%instantiate Demo::Car::fl` created, if there is one; `Demo::car.fl` is always car's `fl`). A package before `.` is an error naming the `::` spelling to use |
| `car.wheels[2]` | one element of a multi-valued feature (`part wheels : Wheel[4]`), counted from 1 in the order the feature holds them |

Reading a path materializes the nested objects it passes through, exactly as `%features car` does.

A command reports an object under the reference that reaches it — `Demo::car.fl`, `#3.wheels[2]` —
with every name spelled as the notation writes it, so what is printed can be typed back and reaches
the same object: walked features are written after `.`, which is only ever a feature, even where the
`::` spelling would name a declaration an object was created under. A declared name that only looks
like an id or an index is quoted (`Demo::'#3'`, `car.'hub[2]'`), where a generated id or index is not;
`#3` is always an id and `[2]` always an index. A name holding `::` inside its quotes stays one
quoted segment (`Demo::'left::right'`, `#1.'in::ner'`) rather than flattening into a qualification
that would read back as two names.

Every command reports a bad reference in the same words:

```
sysml> %features #9
error: no object #9 in this session: nothing materialized has that identity (the objects are #1, #2)
sysml> %features car.nope
error: Demo::car has no feature "nope" (its features are fl, mass, wheels, and 13 more the library declares)
sysml> %features car.mass
error: mass of Demo::car holds a value (1500.0), not an object
sysml> %features car.wheels
error: wheels of Demo::car holds 4 objects: pick one by index, wheels[1] to wheels[4]
sysml> %features car.wheels[5]
error: wheels of Demo::car holds 4 objects, so wheels[5] names none (indexes run from 1 to 4)
sysml> %features Wheel
error: no instance of "Demo::Wheel" (use %instantiate first)
sysml> %features car.spare
error: spare of Demo::car could not be materialized: multiplicity violation …
sysml> %features T::SA-506
error: "T::SA-506" is not an object reference: "-506" cannot follow SA: segments are separated by . or :: — did you mean T::'SA-506'? Names containing '-' must be quoted.
```

The `Wheel` and `car.spare` failures are typed errors: a name nothing was instantiated under, and a
segment whose feature value the runtime could not materialize, which keeps the runtime's reason as
its cause and is recorded among the session's materialization failures like any other command's.
The last is a reference the notation could not read to its end — a segment is an identifier or a
quoted name, so a bare `SA-506` stops at `SA` — and, as for a `<name>`, the failure offers the quoted
declaration the segments read so far are the start of, when there is one.

A name nothing was instantiated under says what to instantiate when related objects exist. A usage
whose definition alone has an object (`%instantiate Rover` when `%state … rover` wanted the usage) is
reported as `no instance of the usage "Demo::rover": object #1 of "Demo::Rover" is of its definition
"Demo::Rover", not of the usage — use %instantiate Demo::rover to create the usage's object, or name
Demo::Rover to address it`; a definition whose only objects are of usages typed by it names those
objects the same way (`no instance of the definition "Demo::Rover" itself: objects #2 of
"Demo::garage.bays[1]", #3 of "Demo::garage.bays[2]" are typed by it — name Demo::garage.bays[1] or
Demo::garage.bays[2] to address one of them, or use %instantiate Demo::Rover to create an object of
the definition`). A usage reaches its definition through the usages it subsets. Only objects the
session already holds are named, the first five of many (`… (3000 in all)`): the error
materializes nothing to find them.

An id denotes an object the session holds: one it named, one a materialized feature of such an object
holds, an anonymous connector `%features` has shown (`(anonymous connector) = Instance(ID: 4)` — `#4`
is the only way to name it), or one a second `%instantiate` of its name displaced. Instantiating a
name a second time makes a new object and says so — `Demo::car now denotes this object; object #1 is displaced from that name
and stays reachable as #1` — and `#1` goes on reaching the first object on every command, listed by
`%instances` as `#1 (ID: 1, displaced from Demo::car)`. A debugging session over the displaced object
keeps running: the same `%instantiate` notes that it now follows the object as `#1` (or as a path
from that id, `#1.r`, for a nested object), and `%step`, `%advance` and `%continue` go on driving it.
Looking an id up materializes nothing: an id the runtime never issued is `no object #9 in this
session: nothing materialized has that identity (the objects are #1, #2)`, and so is one of an object
made in passing — by `%eval in` on a usage nothing was instantiated under, say — which `%instances`
does not list and `#<id>` completion does not offer. A connector is the one object a submission sets
aside: a declaration that leaves its owner's shape alone keeps the owner and attaches the connector's
ends again when it is next read, and the id `%features` printed for it — anonymous or named — goes on
reaching it and being offered by completion in the meantime, naming it being what reads it — that
one alone, its sibling connectors waiting for their own turn. The id follows the connector's own
declaration, however the owner's connectors are reordered or added to around it; the id of one whose
declaration is gone is gone with it, never handed to another. An end that cannot be attached again is
reported with the id, and the id stays reachable for another attempt: `no object #4 in this session:
the connector that had that identity cannot be materialized again: …`. A connector attached whole is
kept — its ends, its writes, its behaviors — even when an older object's behavior then fails
answering it; that failure is reported as the older object's (`#4 is materialized again, but an older
object's behavior failed: …`), and the next command finds `#4` held.

A diagram node's label leads with the element's name, ` : Type` after it for a typed usage, and
puts the kind on the next line in guillemets; the text form keeps the keyword first, as the
notation declares it.

A view that states `render asElementTable;`, or is typed by `StandardViewDefinitions::GridView`,
renders as rows instead: the exposed elements, the elements declared in them, and the views nested
in the rendered one, as aligned columns at the prompt and as a Markdown table with `markdown`.

```
sysml> %render Demo::parts
Demo::parts - table rendering (render asElementTable)

Element        Kind       Type   Declared in
-------------  ---------  -----  -------------
Demo::Vehicle  part def
mass           attribute  Real   Demo::Vehicle
wheel          part       Wheel  Demo::Vehicle

sysml> %render Demo::parts markdown
<!-- Demo::parts — table rendering (render asElementTable) -->
| Element | Kind | Type | Declared in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demo::Vehicle | part def |  |  |

| wheel | part | Wheel | Demo::Vehicle |
```

The rendering is **tool-defined output**: SysML v2 §10.2 specifies the notation a view is written
in, not how a tool draws it. Mermaid is the machine-readable form for the graph-shaped kinds because
it renders as-is in Markdown, documentation sites and editors without a separate rendering tool, and
has a dedicated state diagram grammar. A table is a Markdown table, since Mermaid has no grammar
for tables. A state rendering reads the lowered state graph and an action rendering reads the
lowered action graph, so what is drawn is what the runtime executes.

Graphviz DOT is the alternative to Mermaid for the `tree`, `interconnection`, `state` and
`action` kinds, for a toolchain that lays diagrams out with Graphviz; writing it needs no
Graphviz installation:

```text
sysml> %render Demo::summary dot
// view: Demo::summary
// kind: tree
// layout: dot
digraph "Demo::summary" {
  graph [fontname="Helvetica"];
  node [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=white, color="#181818", fontname="Helvetica", fontsize=14, penwidth=0.5];
  edge [color="#181818", fontname="Helvetica", fontsize=13, penwidth=1];
  "n0" [label=<<b>Vehicle</b><br/><font point-size="10"><i>«part def»</i></font>>];
  "n1" [style="rounded,filled", label=<<b>mass : Real</b><br/><font point-size="10"><i>«attribute»</i></font>>];
  "n0" -> "n1" [arrowhead=none];
  "n2" [style="rounded,filled", label=<<b>wheel : Wheel</b><br/><font point-size="10"><i>«part»</i></font>>];
  "n0" -> "n2" [arrowhead=none];
  "n3" [style="rounded,filled", label=<<b>summary::detail</b><br/><font point-size="10"><i>«view»</i></font>>];
  "n4" [label=<<b>Wheel</b><br/><font point-size="10"><i>«part def»</i></font>>];
  "n5" [style="rounded,filled", label=<<b>diameter : Real</b><br/><font point-size="10"><i>«attribute»</i></font>>];
  "n4" -> "n5" [arrowhead=none];
  "n3" -> "n4" [arrowhead=none];
}
```

The drawing is the Standard B&W style of the SysML v2 Pilot visualizer — white fills, thin
`#181818` lines, square definitions and rounded usages, a bold name over an italic keyword line
([the translation](../project/view-rendering-forms.md#style)). A palette name after `dot` fills
the nodes by keyword family, a `part def` and its `part` usages sharing a hue, with black text
kept legible on every fill:

```text
sysml> %render Demo::summary dot okabe-ito
…
  "n0" [fillcolor="#E69F00", color="#E69F00", penwidth=1, label=<<b>Vehicle</b><br/><font point-size="10"><i>«part def»</i></font>>];
  "n1" [style="rounded,filled", fillcolor="#F9F4B3", color="#F0E442", penwidth=1, label=<<b>mass : Real</b><br/><font point-size="10"><i>«attribute»</i></font>>];
…
```

The palettes are `okabe-ito`, `tol-bright`, `tol-muted`, `tol-light`, `brewer-set2`,
`brewer-dark2`, `viridis` and `cividis` ([their sources](../project/view-rendering-forms.md#palettes));
any other name is refused with that list. A palette is a `dot` or `plantuml` matter:
`%render <name> mermaid` has no place for one, and a `Diagram` block of a document states its own
([`palette`](../manual/authoring.md#diagrams)).

A third word after `dot` names the drawing style: `pilot`, the look above and the default, or
`cameo`, the look of Cameo Systems Modeler — a diagram frame with a `stm [State Machine] … [ … ]`
header tab, 11 pt Arial, gradient fills in Cameo's colours, a state's `do / Activity` compartment
and the UML pseudo-state symbols ([the measurements](../project/view-rendering-forms.md#the-cameo-style)):

```text
sysml> %render Demo::modes dot okabe-ito cameo
```

Any other word is refused with the two styles. A `mermaid` or `plantuml` rendering under a
style other than `pilot` writes a `not represented: style cameo` notice: only the DOT form draws
a diagram in a style. A member's own `DiagramLayout::Style` colours it over either look, and a
`DiagramLayout::Note` is drawn beside the member it is about.

A `sequence` or `table` view has no DOT form, and asking for one tells you which form the kind
uses.

PlantUML is the other alternative, for a PlantUML toolchain — the OMG Pilot's own visualizer
draws with PlantUML — and the one that also writes a `sequence` view. It carries the same B&W
style inline as a `<style>` block, so the file stands alone; writing it needs no Java and no
PlantUML jar:

```text
sysml> %render Demo::summary plantuml
@startuml
' Demo::summary — tree rendering
<style>
…
</style>
skinparam wrapWidth 300
hide stereotype
hide circle
hide empty members
class "**Vehicle**\n<size:10>//«part def»//</size>" as n0 <<part def>>
class "**mass : Real**\n<size:10>//«attribute»//</size>" as n1 <<attribute>> <<usage>>
n0 -- n1
…
@enduml
```

A palette name after `plantuml` fills the same nodes with the same colours DOT would
(`%render Demo::summary plantuml okabe-ito`), a sequence's participants included. A `table`
view has no PlantUML form. PlantUML pins no positions, so a view's `DiagramLayout` geometry
rides along as `'` comments; `dot` is the form that honours it
([the PlantUML form](../project/view-rendering-forms.md#plantuml)).

To render a view outside the prompt, use [`sysml -render`](cli.md#rendering-a-view).
