# SysML v1 to v2 migration

## Status: experimental

The migration is **experimental**. It covers the structural, requirement, constraint, instance,
allocation and behavioral content listed under [Mapping](#mapping), reports every element
it approximates or leaves behind, and refuses input it cannot read; units are not migrated
yet, and what a v1 element is written as may change between releases
without a compatibility path. Every run says so: `sysml -convert` prints `note:` to stderr,
`ConvertResponse` carries `experimental` and `experimental_notice` (the Python client raises
an `ExperimentalFeatureWarning`), and the wording lives once, in `export.MigrationNotice`.

`sysml Model.xmi -convert sysml` reads a SysML v1 model as UML XMI — the open OMG interchange
format every v1 tool exports — and writes it as SysML v2 textual notation. `-convert ttl` writes the same model as
RDF, through [the RDF mapping](rdf-mapping.md). Every run also produces a **migration report**
that accounts for every v1 element: what it became, or why it did not.

```bash
sysml Model.xmi   -convert sysml -o Model.sysml -migration-report Model.report.txt
sysml Model.uml   -convert ttl   -o Model.ttl   -migration-report Model.report.json
sysml Model.mdzip -convert sysml -o Model.sysml
sysml export.xml  -convert sysml -from xmi
```

The input format is inferred from the `.xmi`, `.uml` and `.mdzip` extensions; any other name
needs `-from xmi` (`uml` and `mdzip` are accepted as synonyms). XMI is read only — `-convert xmi` is refused,
since v2 has no v1 form — and it is never loaded into the REPL, an `-eval` or a check directly:
migrate first, then work with the notation.

The same conversion is available over gRPC (`Convert` with `from_format: "xmi"`, or a
`file_path` ending in `.xmi`/`.uml`/`.mdzip`) and so from every client library; the report is not
returned over the service yet.

## Input

- **[OMG XMI 2.5.1](https://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/2.5.1) with
  [UML 2.5.x](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5.1)**, with the
  [OMG SysML 1.x profile](https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/1.6)'s stereotypes applied
  (`sysml:Block`, `sysml:Requirement`, … as `base_Class`/`base_Property` applications). This is
  the interchange export every SysML v1 tool offers, and a tool's export is read as far as it
  is this standard. The UML and SysML namespace versions are not pinned; any
  `http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/…` / `…/SysML/…` namespace is recognized.
- **Zip archives holding the XMI**, a MagicDraw / Cameo `.mdzip` project among them: the
  archive's `uml_model.model` entries are read, or, in an archive without them, every `.xmi`,
  `.xml` and `.uml` entry that is an XMI document. Used projects (archives the model refers
  to) are not read; elements they hold appear as external proxies and are reported as
  unmapped where they are relationship ends.
- **Eclipse UML2 `.uml` files** as [Papyrus](https://eclipse.dev/papyrus/) and its SysML 1.6
  component write them: a bare `uml:Model` root in the `http://www.eclipse.org/uml2/…/UML`
  namespace, with the SysML profile in `http://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/sysml/1.6/SysML/…`.
  Elements referenced by `href` into another resource are not read; they appear as external
  proxies and are reported as unmapped where they are relationship ends.
- A `uml:Diagram` a tool's `xmi:Extension` holds, with the diagram representation MagicDraw
  and Cameo write (`diagramRepresentation` → `DiagramRepresentationObject` with its `type`,
  `umlType` and the `usedElements` it shows), is read as a tool-neutral diagram record: its
  name, kind, `ownerOfDiagram` and shown elements, and is written as a `view` (see
  [Diagrams](#diagrams)). The representation object is found by how it is held or tagged, or
  failing that by the `umlType` it states; a child with a plain `type` (a comment, a legend, a
  property) is not it, and what it lists is not shown; a diagram without a representation shows
  nothing, whatever else the tool lists inside it. In an `.mdzip`, every diagram is read from
  the archive entry its `binaryObject` names (the stream MagicDraw serializes the diagram's
  symbols to): each symbol's `elementID` is a shown element, and a symbol naming none — a
  pasted image, a text box, a note — is counted as free content, so a blank diagram is told
  from one drawing elements the list omits, and a list that names elements is completed with
  the symbols the stream adds; a pasted image's bytes are written to a file the view draws
  (see [Pictures pasted onto a diagram](#pictures-pasted-onto-a-diagram)). The list also names what a symbol displays without one of its
  own — a property in a compartment, a trigger on a transition — so a listed element is kept
  when a symbol stands for it or for an element it is owned under, and dropped when none
  does, since nothing drawn shows it. Layout and the rest of the extension —
  tool-internal state, a Papyrus `.notation` file — are skipped; the report says so once per
  skipped profile or library package. A package is library content
  when it is a standard or tool profile (a user profile is written, see
  [Profiles and stereotypes](#profiles-and-stereotypes), however the tool marks it — one marked
  «auxiliaryResource» still holds the stereotypes whose applications carry the user's data), is
  marked «ModelLibrary» or «auxiliaryResource», or is a document root
  beside the user's Model or package bearing a standard library name; a user package named
  `SysML` or `Libraries` inside the model, or standing alone as the document's only root, is
  migrated like any other.
- The one extension content read is a `uml:ElementValue` a tool keeps there because UML has
  no such metaclass (MagicDraw's reference to a property from inside an Expression tree): it
  is an operand of the element owning the extension, in document order, however the tool
  wraps it; one inside a serialized diagram is the diagram's content, not an operand.
- Only stereotypes from the OMG SysML and UML standard profiles, in the OMG namespaces or
  Papyrus' `…/papyrus/sysml/…` ones, classify elements — applied directly, or through a user
  stereotype that specializes one (see [Profiles and stereotypes](#profiles-and-stereotypes)).
  Any other profile's «Block» or «Requirement» with no standard general — a user's own, a
  tool's customization layer over SysML, or another profile Papyrus hosts — carries no SysML
  meaning: it is written as metadata when the document defines it, and preserved as an
  applied-stereotype comment otherwise.
- A requirement's `id` and `text` tags are read in the profile's spelling and in the
  capitalized `Id`/`Text` some exporters write.
- Multiplicity follows UML's defaults: an omitted bound is 1, and a bound element without a
  `value` is 0.
- A type referenced by `href` is a `ScalarValues` type only when the href points into the UML
  or SysML primitive libraries — by a plain fragment (`PrimitiveTypes.xmi#Real`), a dotted one
  (`SysML.xmi#SysML_dataType.Real`), or an opaque id whose qualified name the tool records
  beside it (MagicDraw's `referentPath`) under a standard library root, out of a module named
  for that library (`UML_Standard_Profile.mdzip`). A tool library's own
  machine-level datatypes (`float`, `double`, `int`, `long`, `short`, `byte`, `boolean`) are
  written as `Real`/`Integer`/`Boolean` and reported as approximations; a used project's own
  `Real` stays external, even when the project's top package borrows a library's name.
- A constraint block's properties are its parameters, `in attribute`s when typed by a value
  type and `in ref part` / `in ref item` when typed by a block or signal, whether the tool
  stores them as UML Properties or (as MagicDraw does, under a «ConstraintParameter» marker) as
  UML Ports; a `private` or `protected` parameter is written public, since the owning block's
  binding connectors reach it from outside, and the report notes the dropped visibility.

## Mapping

| SysML v1 | SysML v2 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Model, Package | `package` | mapped |
| «Block», plain Class, Actor | `part def` | mapped (Actor and plain Class: approximated) |
| «InterfaceBlock» | `port def` | mapped |
| «ValueType» DataType, PrimitiveType | `attribute def` (`Real`/`Integer`/`Boolean`/`String` for the SysML primitives) | mapped |
| Signal | `item def`; properties typed by it are `item` / `ref item` | mapped |
| Enumeration and its literals | `enum def` | mapped |
| «ConstraintBlock» | `constraint def` with its parameters | mapped |
| «Requirement», «AbstractRequirement» | `requirement def <id>` with `doc` holding the text; any tool-specific requirement kind applied beside it as a comment | mapped |
| «TestCase» | `verification def` | approximated: its behavior is not migrated |
| InstanceSpecification of a block, of a constraint block | `individual part def`, `individual constraint def`, with its slots | mapped |
| InstanceSpecification of an interface block | `individual def` (v2 has no individual port def); an instance classified by an interface block beside a block is an `individual part def` of the block alone | mapped |
| Slot of a value property | `attribute :>> x = value;` | mapped |
| Slot of a part, item or constraint property holding one instance | `individual part :>> x : 'the instance';` — `ref` when the property is | mapped |
| Slot of a part, item or constraint property holding several instances | `part :>> x [n];` then one `individual part : 'the instance' :> x;` each | mapped |
| InstanceSpecification of a value type | `attribute` typed by it, holding its slot values (an individual cannot specialize an attribute def) | mapped |
| InstanceSpecification naming no classifier, under a `SimulationConfig`'s `resultLocation`, whose slots are of features of one lineage of blocks ending in the configuration's target classifier or a general of it (a simulation tool's result snapshot) | the `individual part def` of the most special of those blocks, with its slots; the note says which owner classified it and for which configuration | mapped |
| InstanceSpecification naming no classifier, anywhere else, or under a `resultLocation` with slots of features of blocks that are no one lineage or none the target is of | comment | **unmapped** — nothing classifies it; under a `resultLocation` the note says which owners its slots have and why they type no snapshot |
| Slot contradicting its feature (more values than the multiplicity allows, a repeated value of a unique feature, a feature of a classifier the instance is not written to specialize, an instance that is not of the property's type or of its default individual, a value outside the document) | comment | **unmapped** |
| Slot of a port, or of an untyped property | comment (no individual can type a port; a `ref` without a type takes none) | **unmapped** |
| Property whose default is an InstanceSpecification of a block | the individual added to the usage's types, or its only type when the property is untyped; no `default` (a definition is not a v2 value). A port, a usage of another kind than the individual, or a usage whose type the individual is not an instance of, keeps its types and the default is a comment | approximated |
| Literal default on a value type with no scalar base (a structured value type, an enumeration) | comment | approximated |
| Real literal on an `Integer`/`Natural` feature, numeric string on a scalar feature | converted to the feature's scalar | mapped |
| Constraint whose specification is a literal, instance or opaque body yielding no Boolean (an integer, a real, a string spelling no `true`/`false`, an enumeration literal) | comment naming the value and the Boolean the constraint yields | **unmapped** — no v2 checker accepts a constraint body of another type; a string `"true"`/`"false"` is written as the Boolean it spells |
| Constraint whose specification is a `uml:Expression` tree with no symbol at any node and, as leaves, only `InstanceValue`s naming no instance (a tool's presentation constraint on a document, a Cameo Collaborator marker) | nothing: the tree spells nothing | skipped — notation only; a tree with a symbol, or a leaf naming an instance, is translated or refused like any other expression |
| Association with a name, «AssociationBlock» | `connection def` | mapped |
| Anonymous association with a classifier-owned end | nothing: the end property carries it | mapped |
| Anonymous association owning every end | a named `connection def` | approximated |
| Value property | `attribute`, with multiplicity and default | mapped |
| Composite part property | `part` | mapped |
| Reference property (no aggregation) | `ref part` | mapped |
| Undirected part or item property of an «InterfaceBlock» | `ref part` / `ref item`; a port owns no composite parts | approximated |
| Shared aggregation | `ref part` | approximated |
| «ConstraintProperty» | `constraint` usage | mapped |
| Redefinition | `:>>` | mapped |
| Generalization | `:>` | mapped |
| Port, «ProxyPort», «FullPort» typed by an InterfaceBlock / Block | `port`, `~` when conjugated | mapped |
| «FlowPort» typed by a value type | `port` holding one `in`/`out`/`inout` attribute | approximated |
| «FlowProperty» | directed `attribute`/`item` in the port def | mapped |
| `private` feature reached from outside by a connector, a slot, a redefinition, a subset or an expression | visibility dropped so the reference resolves; the report names the reacher — a connector or slot that is itself left as a comment reaches nothing | approximated |
| `private`, `package` or `protected` packaged element (a block, value type, enumeration…) | visibility dropped: a v2 private member is out of reach of every other package, which v1 tools do not enforce, so an import brings it in | approximated |
| Property or port sharing the name of an inherited feature without redefining it | `:>>` the inherited feature when both are the same kind of usage; otherwise the collision is reported and left | approximated |
| Connector, nested ends | `connect a.b to c.d` | mapped |
| «BindingConnector» | `bind`, or `binding name bind` when named | mapped |
| InformationFlow / «ItemFlow» over a connector | `flow of Item from a.x to b.y` | mapped |
| «Satisfy» | `satisfy requirement … by …` in the satisfying usage's owner | mapped |
| «Verify» from a test case | `verify` in the verification def | mapped |
| «DeriveReqt» | `connection … :> RequirementDerivation::Derivation` | mapped |
| «Allocate» | `allocate a to b`, or `allocation name allocate a to b` when named; an end that is an activity node is named under the `action def` the activity is written as (the operation, for a method), so an allocation to a call action written as a declared stub is written too | mapped |
| «Allocate», or another dependency, whose end is an activity node written only as a placeholder (a call that is not migrated) | the relationship is written to the placeholder; the pair ending there counts as failed when its end is not migrated, so the note gives the final tally of pairs written and names the end | approximated when another pair is written, **unmapped** when none is |
| «Refine» | `dependency` carrying `@ModelingMetadata::Refinement` | mapped |
| «Trace», «Copy», other stereotyped dependencies | plain `dependency` with the stereotype as a comment; named relationships keep their name | approximated |
| A user stereotype specializing a standard one («Org Requirement» :> «Requirement», or one specializing «Block», «ValueType», «Satisfy», «Verify», «Refine», «Trace», «DeriveReqt», «Allocate», …) | the standard stereotype's v2 form above, its tags read as the standard ones (`Id`, `Text`, …), plus a `@Profile::'Org Requirement' { … }` usage holding the user-added tags | as the standard form |
| Comment, Documentation | `doc` (first) / `comment`, HTML tags stripped | mapped |
| User profile | `package` holding its stereotypes and the enumerations and value types they use | mapped |
| User stereotype | `metadata def`, `:>` the defs of the user stereotypes it specializes; tag definitions `attribute name : String|Integer|Real|Boolean|<enum def>` or `ref name` for element-typed ones, with the v1 multiplicity; `base_*` extension ends and the `Extension`s written as nothing | mapped (a general outside the document, or closing a cycle: approximated) |
| User stereotype application, on an element, property or relationship the document defines the stereotype of | `@Profile::Name { tag = value; }` in the element's body (`@Profile::Name;` without tags); strings, numbers and booleans as literals, enumeration literals by name, element references by the written element's name, HTML-bodied text as plain text; a tag the stereotype does not define, or a value not of the tag's type, a comment | mapped (a value kept as a comment: approximated) |
| Stereotype applied from a profile the document does not define (a used project not in the archive, an unknown namespace) | preserved as `/* applied stereotype «Name»: tag = value */`; the report names the namespace | mapped, noted |
| MagicDraw's property-kind markers — «ValueProperty», «PartProperty», «SharedProperty», «ReferenceProperty», «ConstraintProperty» on a UML Property, and «ConstraintParameter» on a constraint block's parameter — recognised by the provenance of their profile (`magicdraw.com` or `nomagic.com`, under `/spec/Customization/`), carrying no tag, on a property whose usage keyword (`attribute`, `part`, `ref part`, `constraint`, `in …`) already says the kind | nothing: the declaration stays one line. A same-named stereotype from any other profile, a marker carrying a tag, or one on a property written as another kind (a «ValueProperty» on a block-typed part) is kept as above | mapped |
| SysML stereotype tags without a v2 form (`Block.isEncapsulated`, `ValueType.unit`, …) | preserved as `/* «Name» tags with no v2 form: tag = value */` | approximated |
| Two members of one namespace with the same name (UML allows it, v2 does not) | the later one renamed `Name 2`, a state, pseudostate or history a machine's region puts beside its attributes included, as is a written connection point of a state whichever region a tool listed it in, while one written as no member takes no name; a connection end named like a member of its connection def renamed `name2` | approximated |
| Anonymous property with no v2 type | a `ref` named after its type, or `unnamed` | approximated |
| Multiplicity bounds that are not natural numbers (a tool's `492x21` array dimensions) | omitted | approximated |
| `NaN`/infinite real literals | comment | approximated |
| References to ids the document does not define | the resolvable ends are written; the missing ids are named in the report | approximated |
| OpaqueExpression defaults and constraints | copied verbatim when it parses as a v2 expression and every name it uses is a written element visible where it is written (a parameter, an inherited feature, an enclosing member); a JavaScript or English body is translated through the [opaque-language subset](#the-opaque-language-subset) when every name resolves the same way (`V = R * i` → `V == R * i`, `java.util.Collections.max(s)` → `RealFunctions::max(s)`); a body outside the subset stays a `comment` and the report names the offending token | mapped / approximated |
| UML Expression, StringExpression (a constraint's specification, a default, a slot value) | the operator tree lowered to a v2 expression: arithmetic (`+ - * / %`, unary minus), comparison, `and`/`or`/`not` — each spelled as its sign or its name in any case (`Plus`, `Equal`, `Not`) — a literal, an enumeration literal or instance the scope can name, a feature reference (a bare symbol, or an ElementValue naming a feature the scope reads under that name), and a call whose symbol is in the [opaque-language subset](#the-opaque-language-subset)'s function table (`max` → `RealFunctions::max`, `Power` → `**`); a JavaScript or Java opaque operand is read through the same subset in its own language | mapped |
| UML Expression with an operator outside that set (`xor`, string concatenation, a call not in the table, an operand in a language the subset does not read, an ElementValue naming nothing or an element the scope does not read under its name) | comment naming the tree and the construct refused | **unmapped** |
| UML Interface | `port def` | mapped |
| InterfaceRealization from a block | a `port` of the `part def` typed by the interface's `port def` — reused when the block already owns one so typed, otherwise added under the interface's name; a `part def` cannot specialize a `port def` | approximated |
| InterfaceRealization from an «InterfaceBlock» | `port def :> <Interface>` | mapped |
| InterfaceRealization whose interface is not written (outside the document, library content) or whose client becomes neither a part def nor a port def | comment naming why | **unmapped** |
| UseCase (whatever incidental stereotype a tool applies to it) | `use case def`; its UML `subject` is a `subject` usage (v2 admits one per case: a second is a `ref part` with a note); an anonymous association to an Actor is an `actor` of the use case typed by the actor's `part def`, with the association's multiplicity; a `classifierBehavior` is performed as in a block | mapped |
| Include | `include use case <name> : <Included>;` | mapped |
| Extend, ExtensionPoint | `dependency <Extending> to <Extended>;` in the extending case, the extension points and condition as a comment; v2 has no `extend` | approximated / **unmapped** (extension point) |
| Include, Extend whose other case is not in the document | comment | **unmapped** |
| Property typed by a UseCase | `ref use case x : <Case>;` | approximated |
| «View» Class | package-level `view <Name>` usage (v2 admits `expose` in a usage alone): `satisfy <Viewpoint>` for its `viewpoint` tag and its «Conform» generalizations and dependencies; `expose` members for its «Expose» dependencies; its «View» property typed by another view a nested `view x :> <Other>;`, `ref` when not composite | mapped |
| «View» Package | `view <Name>` usage holding the package's members | approximated |
| «View» whose `viewpoint` tag or «Conform» names a viewpoint that is not written, or a view a nested view's feature of an inaccessible definition | the view without that `satisfy`/subsetting, the reason in the report | approximated |
| «Expose» Dependency | `expose <Supplier>;` in the client view — `expose <Package>::**;` for a package, since v1 exposes its contents | mapped |
| «Expose» whose supplier is a diagram, by id or by an `href` whose fragment is the diagram's id | `expose <View>;` naming the view the diagram is written as (see [Diagrams](#diagrams)), qualified from the client view's body | mapped |
| «Expose» whose supplier is outside the document or not written (a diagram no written element can hold included), or whose client is not a view | comment | **unmapped** |
| «Conform» Generalization, Dependency | `satisfy <Viewpoint>;` in the view | mapped |
| «Conform» whose client is not a view or whose supplier is not a viewpoint | comment | **unmapped** |
| «Viewpoint» Class | package-level `viewpoint <Name>` usage: `purpose`, `language`, `method` and `presentation` tags in a `doc`; each `stakeholder` tag a `stakeholder x : <Stakeholder>` usage; each `concern` tag and each `concernList` comment a `frame concern { doc /* … */ }`; a stakeholder or concern id that is not in the document is named in the report | mapped / approximated |
| «Stakeholder» Class | `part def`; the OMG standard library bundled here defines no `Stakeholder` base definition, so nothing is specialized; the `concern` tag stays a comment | approximated |
| Activity | `action def` (see [Behaviors](#behaviors)); a block's `classifierBehavior` is also performed by a `perform action` usage of the `part def` | mapped |
| Parameter, ActivityParameterNode | `in`/`out`/`inout` parameter of the `action def`; a `return` parameter is `out`; the parameter node's flows bind the parameter | mapped (return: approximated) |
| InitialNode, ActivityFinalNode, FlowFinalNode | `first start then …`; `action x terminate;`; the token ends where a flow final does | mapped |
| ForkNode, JoinNode, DecisionNode, MergeNode | `fork`, `join`, `decide`, `merge`; a node several edges leave or reach without a control node gets one written for it | mapped (implicit fork/join: approximated) |
| CallBehaviorAction | `action x : Def;` with `bind`/`flow` for its pins; a call of no behavior whose only content is a duration is a leaf step, the wait written for it; a call of a state machine or of a behavior with no v2 declaration | mapped (a leaf step: mapped, "a step with a duration and no further behavior") / **unmapped** |
| CallBehaviorAction naming no behavior, with pins | a declared stub, `action x { in a : T; out r : U[0..1]; }` — its pins its parameters, typed and bounded as the pins are, in the same successions, forks and joins as a bare step; the flows into and out of them are written; each output pin is declared admitting no value, since nothing computes it; the note says the action computes nothing. A call whose `behavior` reference resolves to nothing in the document is not a stub: it stays a placeholder | approximated (unresolved behavior: **unmapped**) |
| InputPin / OutputPin of a call, past the called behavior's parameters of its direction | the call keeps the parameters its callee declares, so no parameter is added for the pin, which is dropped with the flows through it; the note names the called behavior and its parameters of that direction. Only a stub naming no behavior declares parameters for its pins, having no parameter list of its own | **unmapped** (the pin and its flows; the call itself stays mapped) |
| CallBehaviorAction of an fUML or Alf library primitive (`fUML_Library.xmi#…`, `Alf-Library.xmi#…`, any date; or MagicDraw's `fUML-Library.mdzip#…` with the bundled copy or `referentPath` under the library's own root package) | the action with its pins, each result pin valued by the v2 library expression over the arguments, `out result : ScalarValues::String = StringFunctions::'+'(x, y);`; see [the table](#calls-to-the-fuml-and-alf-libraries) | mapped / approximated (the note says where v2 differs) / **unmapped** (no v2 equivalent: the note says which) |
| CallOperationAction | `perform action x ::> target.op;` when the target pin's value is an object whose type owns the operation, or when `onPort` names a port a connector of the caller's block joins to a part that owns it (a port of the target itself names it); otherwise `action x : Owner::Op;`, which runs in the caller's context | mapped / approximated (unresolved target: the reason names it) |
| ControlFlow | `first a then b;`, `if <guard>` when the guard parses and resolves as a v2 expression or translates from JavaScript or English (`i >= Retries`, `GS_Found`, `not Found and i < 3`, `TRUE`) through the [subset](#the-opaque-language-subset); otherwise the guard text as a comment and the edge unguarded, the report naming the token refused | mapped / approximated |
| «Probability» on the edges out of a decision, a number | `first d then x { @Stochastic::Probability { p = <value>; } }`; constants not summing to 1 are scaled by their sum; a value outside `[0, 1]` leaves the decision unweighted | mapped / approximated |
| «Probability» naming a property (by name or `xmi:id`) visible from the activity — its own, or one of the block whose classifier behavior it is, inherited included — typed by a numeric value type and holding one value | `p = <property>;`, a reference the run reads from the object performing the action when the decision is reached, checking then that it lies in `[0, 1]` and the branches sum to 1 | mapped |
| «Probability» naming a property that is not visible, private to another block, not numeric, or of a multiplicity other than one; naming an element that is no property; or no property or number at all | the decision is written unweighted; the note says what the tag names and why it is no weight | approximated |
| Edge out of a weighted decision carrying no «Probability» | weighted with its share of what the marked edges leave of 1 — a constant, or `1.0 - <property>` read when the decision is reached | approximated |
| «Probability» from a profile other than the OMG SysML profile (recognised by its namespace, as every standard stereotype is) | no weight is read from it: the edge is treated as one carrying no «Probability»; the note names the profile the stereotype comes from | approximated |
| «SimulationConfig» (MagicDraw's SimulationProfile) | `action def` holding `@Simulation::Configuration { runs = …; draws = …; timeVariable = …; startTime = …; stepSize = …; timeUnit = …; parallelForks = …; }`, `part target : <the migrated executionTarget>;` and `perform action run ::> target.<its classifier behavior>;` (see [Run configurations](#run-configurations)); its remaining tags a comment | mapped |
| «SimulationConfig» whose `executionTarget` is absent, several, outside the document, not migrated, or written as something no part can be typed by; whose target has no classifier behavior, or one that is a state machine | the `action def` with its metadata and, where the target is written, its `target` part, performing nothing; the note says why | approximated |
| «SimulationConfig» `durationSimulationMode` that is none of `min`, `max`, `average`, `random` | kept among the tags in the comment | approximated |
| Result snapshots of a «SimulationConfig» (the instances under its `resultLocation` packages classified — by name or by their slots — by its target's classifiers, recording no other values of the features the target's slots set) | the individuals above, and one row per snapshot in the JSON `-migration-results` writes, its numeric slots by defining feature; a slot holding no one finite number a float64 spells exactly, and a feature two slots hold numbers for, are counted in the configuration's notes | mapped |
| Generalization of MagicDraw's `MonteCarloAnalysis` (the analysis pattern of the SysML customization module, recognised by the module's provenance — a user's own block of that name is an ordinary block) | the block's `part def` without that general, and beside it `analysis def '<Block> Monte Carlo' :> Simulation::MonteCarlo` with the part def as `subject`, `perform action run ::> <subject>.<its classifier behavior>` and `attribute :>> observed = <subject>.<the value bound to Mean>` (see [Monte Carlo analyses](#monte-carlo-analyses)) | approximated: the block is split into a part def and an analysis def |
| «BindingConnector» of a value property to `MonteCarloAnalysis::Mean`, `::Deviation`, `::N` or `::OutOfSpec` (the connector's owner inheriting the pattern) | the analysis def's `observed` (from the `Mean` binding) and one `return`/`out` per statistic — `return Mean : Real = mean;`, `out Deviation : Real[0..1] = deviation;`, `out N : Natural = runs;`, `out OutOfSpec : Natural = outOfSpec;` — `Real` for `Mean` and `Deviation`, the bound value's scalar for `N` and `OutOfSpec`; a note says when that is not the value's own type | mapped / approximated |
| «BindingConnector» to another statistic of `MonteCarloAnalysis`, to a value of no numeric type, one of several binding the same statistic, one whose owner does not inherit the pattern, or to a statistic other than `Mean` where nothing is bound to `Mean` | comment naming the statistic and the reason | **unmapped** |
| Slots of `MonteCarloAnalysis::N`, `::Mean`, `::Deviation`, `::OutOfSpec` in a result snapshot | `analysis 'Monte Carlo' : '<Block> Monte Carlo' { subject :>> <subject> : '<the snapshot>'; out :>> runs = …; out :>> mean = …; … }` in the snapshot's individual, and the snapshot's `"statistics"` in the sidecar | mapped |
| ObjectFlow | `flow a.out to b.in;`, or `bind` to a parameter; each producer-pin pair is written once however many edges carry it; a flow from or to an action that is not migrated, or from an output pin a translated opaque body never assigns, is a comment | mapped / approximated |
| SendSignalAction | `action x send new Sig(args) to <target>;`, `via <port>` when `onPort` is set; the target is read from the target pin's flow: `this`, `this.part` where a structural read feeds the pin, else the pin itself (`in target;` bound to what feeds it, an activity parameter or another node's output), which the runtime evaluates to the object it holds | mapped / approximated |
| AcceptEventAction | `action x accept p : Sig;` (signal trigger), `accept after <d> [SI::s]` (relative TimeEvent), `accept when <cond>` (ChangeEvent) | mapped |
| AcceptEventAction on an absolute TimeEvent (`when` is an instant, not a duration) | `accept at <instant>`, the instant a `Time::TimeInstantValue` attribute of the `action def` when `when` is a number with a time unit or an expression that resolves; otherwise a comment | approximated (the instant is read on the simulation clock, which starts at 0) / **unmapped** |
| OpaqueAction, ValueSpecificationAction, ReadStructuralFeatureAction, AddStructuralFeatureValueAction | `assign`/`out result = …` when the body parses as a v2 expression whose names resolve, or is a JavaScript body of the [subset](#the-opaque-language-subset): `i = 1; GS_Found = true;` is a sequence of `assign` statements, `i += 1` an assignment of `i + 1`, `var t = 0` a local `attribute`; names resolve against the action's own pins first, then the swimlane's represented object, then the activity, then the owning block; otherwise the body as a comment inside `action x { }` naming the language and the token refused | mapped / approximated |
| DurationConstraint on an action | a wait before the action: `accept after lo [SI::s]` when the interval is a point, `accept after RandomFunctions::uniform(lo, hi) [SI::s]` otherwise; `1s`, `0.5 s`, `80ms`, `2 min`, `1 h` and `t = 1 minute 30 seconds` literals are scaled to seconds, and a bare number (`200`, a LiteralInteger, `t = 1500`) is in the simulation toolkit's default unit, the millisecond, with a note; a symbolic bound (`ditSetup s`, `setup * 2 min`) is an expression whose names resolve like an action body's, `accept after this.tcs.ditSetup [SI::s]`, one with no unit scaled from milliseconds, `this.settle * 0.001` | approximated (a tool's min/max/average/random mode is the run's `-draws` policy, which its configuration records) |
| DurationConstraint whose interval is open on one side (a min with no max, a max of `*`, a max with no min) | comment naming the bound it lacks | **unmapped** — every wait past the bound satisfies the interval, so no one delay stands for it; a MagicDraw document's min beside a max that is a duration with no expression is that tool's encoding of a one-valued `{60s}` and is written as its fixed wait, approximated |
| DurationConstraint whose bounds name nothing the activity can read | comment | **unmapped** — the note names the unresolved name |
| DurationObservation whose events are two nodes of one activity | an `attribute <name> : Real [0..1]` of the `action def`, stamped with `localClock.currentTime` when the first node starts and assigned the elapsed clock when the second ends (`assign T := localClock.currentTime - 'T start';`, guarded on the stamp having happened); one node observed is its own duration; an initial node's start is the activity's `start`, a flow final's or a control node no edge leaves the token's arrival before `done`; the attribute is one a run can `-observe`, and a run that does not reach both nodes leaves it without a value | mapped |
| DurationObservation reading the clock at the end of a node that is no action — an initial, final, flow final or control node has no end of its own | comment | **unmapped** — the note names the node |
| DurationObservation whose events are not nodes of the activity, or none, or name an element the document does not define; a DurationObservation or TimeObservation owned outside an activity; TimeObservation | comment | **unmapped** — the note names the events, or the owner |
| ActivityPartition | comment naming the partition, what it `represents` and its nodes; a name a body or guard in the partition uses is resolved against the represented property first and written through it, `this.tcs.i` for a partition representing the part `tcs` (a nested partition through its enclosing ones, `this.tank.valve.open`; a partition representing the context block itself, `this.x`) | mapped when the partition resolved a name / approximated when nothing in it needed one, when `represents` is unset, names nothing the document defines, a property of no v2 type, or a classifier the activity does not run in |
| StructuredActivityNode, SequenceNode | `action x { }` holding the nested flow | mapped |
| ExpansionRegion, LoopNode, ConditionalNode | `action x { }` holding the body's flow once; the expansion, the loop test and the clause tests are not written | approximated |
| StateMachine | `state def` (see [Behaviors](#behaviors)); a block's `classifierBehavior` is also exhibited by an `exhibit state` usage of the `part def` | mapped |
| State, composite State, Region | `state`; the regions of an orthogonal state are sub-states of a `parallel` state | mapped |
| State with `submachine` | `state s : SubMachineDef;` — the referenced state machine's own `state def`, not inlined | mapped |
| Pseudostate initial, FinalState | `entry; then s;`, `done` | mapped |
| Pseudostate choice, junction | `junction x;` / `choice x;` — a transient node the guarded transitions leave at once | mapped; under `-strict`, refused as unmapped: `junction <name>;` / `choice <name>;` is an OpenSysML extension |
| Pseudostate fork, join | `fork x;` / `join x;` — the transitions out of a fork enter the states of several regions of a `parallel` state, those into a join leave them | mapped |
| Pseudostate shallowHistory, deepHistory | `history x;` / `deep history x;` in the composite state; a transition targeting it re-enters the substate (the innermost substates) active when the state was last left, the history's own outgoing transition being its default | mapped; under `-strict`, refused as unmapped: `history <name>;` / `deep history <name>;` is an OpenSysML extension |
| Pseudostate entryPoint, exitPoint on a state machine | a `state` of the submachine's `state def`; a transition into an entry point continues by the entry point's own transition, a transition out of an exit point leaves the submachine state | mapped |
| Pseudostate entryPoint on a composite State (`State.connectionPoint`) | `junction x;` of the state, a transition into it written `then Work::x` by path; the runtime runs the state's entry behavior, then the junction's outgoing transition, then the target's entries, in one run-to-completion step. One whose outgoing transitions each start a different orthogonal region is `fork x;`; one no transition leaves is the state's default entry, and the transition is written to the state | mapped; under `-strict`, the junction form is refused as unmapped: `junction <name>;` is an OpenSysML extension (the fork and default-entry forms are standard and stay) |
| Pseudostate exitPoint on a composite State | `junction x;` of the state, a transition out of it written `first Work::x` by path; the runtime runs the transition into it (its source's exits, its effect), the state's exit behavior, then the outgoing transition. One reached from several orthogonal regions is `join x;`, left through when every region's transition has fired. A connection point a tool lists among a region's vertices belongs to the state all the same; a region listing nothing else is skipped, not written as a region of a `parallel` state | mapped; under `-strict`, the junction form is refused as unmapped: `junction <name>;` is an OpenSysML extension (the join form is standard and stays) |
| Entry point leading straight to an exit point of the same state, back to the state itself, out of the state, into a history pseudostate or to no target, or whose outgoing transition has a trigger, or several of whose outgoing transitions start the same region; an exit point reached from outside its state, one no transition leaves or whose outgoing transition has a trigger, leads back to the state or into it, into a history pseudostate or to no target, or one several regions reach that is also reached twice from one region, from the state's own local transition, or from a pseudostate; a connection point route into a history pseudostate | refused with the shape named | unmapped |
| Pseudostate exitPoint on a region, terminate | a transition into it is written to `done` | approximated |
| ConnectionPointReference on a submachine state | the transition is written to `s.<entryPoint>` / from `s.<exitPoint>`, the submachine's state named by its path | mapped |
| Transition between regions or nesting levels (source or target not a sibling) | the transition names the far end by its path, `Work::Run`; a local transition into a substate of its source is written external, so the composite state exits and re-enters | mapped (local into own substate: approximated) |
| `entry`, `doActivity`, `exit` behaviors | `entry action { … }` / `do action { … }` / `exit action { … }` inline when the behavior is owned by the state, `entry x;` / `do x : Def;` by reference otherwise | mapped |
| Transition | `transition first s accept Sig if <guard> do <effect> then t;`; several triggers are several transitions; a completion transition is `transition first s then t;`; the guard is the transition's `guard` child or the owned rule its `guard` reference names, and a `LiteralBoolean` guard whose value the file omits is `false`, the UML default | mapped (several triggers: approximated) |
| `entry`, `doActivity`, `exit` behavior or transition `effect` that is an Activity with no nodes | an empty action: `entry action x;` in a state, `do action x { }` on a transition, whose target follows on the next line | mapped (the note says the action is empty) |
| `entry`, `doActivity`, `exit` behavior or transition `effect` that is an Activity whose every action node is refused | the action, holding the flow and a comment for each refused node; the behavior runs nothing | approximated (each node: **unmapped**) |
| `entry`, `doActivity`, `exit` behavior or transition `effect` that is an OpaqueBehavior in a language the mapping cannot write | the action, holding the body as a comment | approximated |
| Transition `effect` referring to a behavior owned elsewhere | `do action : Def` on the transition, the target following on the next line; the behavior's own `action def` is written once where it is owned | mapped |
| `entry`, `doActivity`, `exit` behavior or transition `effect` referring to a behavior that is not written, or is written as something no state runs (a StateMachine, for one) | comment in the state's body or before the transition's target; the state or transition is written without it | approximated (the state or transition: "its … is not run"; a behavior not written: **unmapped**) |
| Transition `effect` with `in` parameters | the accepted signal is named, `accept sig : Sig`, and each parameter typed by the signal (or a general of it), or the sole untyped one, is bound to it: `in p : Sig = sig;`; a parameter of another type takes no value | mapped (an unbound parameter: approximated) |
| State `deferrableTrigger` on a SignalEvent | `defer Sig;` in the state's body — the OpenSysML `defer` extension (see [Behavior](../guide/06-behavior.md)), which the runtime executes and the validator reports as non-standard notation | approximated; under `-strict`, refused as unmapped: `defer <event>;` is an OpenSysML extension |
| Internal transition (`kind = internal`) | a self transition of the state; faithful when the state has no entry, exit or do behavior and no substates (re-entry is not observable), otherwise the exit and entry run where v1 stayed in the state; one without a trigger is a comment, as a self transition would fire again on every re-entry | mapped / approximated / **unmapped** |
| `deferrableTrigger` on any other event | comment | **unmapped** — no v2 form |
| State `stateInvariant` | comment in the state's body quoting the constraint; the state is written with a body so the comment has a place | **unmapped** — no v2 form |
| Initial transition with a trigger or guard | the region's `entry; then s;`; each trigger and the guard are dropped and reported apart from the transition | approximated (the trigger, the guard: unmapped) |
| SignalEvent, ChangeEvent, relative TimeEvent | written where a trigger refers to them, as `accept Sig`, `accept when <cond>`, `accept after <d> [SI::s]` | mapped / approximated |
| Absolute TimeEvent a trigger refers to | `accept at <instant>` on the transition or accept action, the instant an attribute of the `state def`/`action def` typed `Time::TimeInstantValue` when `when` is a number with a time unit or an expression that resolves, read on the simulation clock, which starts at 0 | approximated (the clock's origin is the run's, not the calendar's) |
| Event (of any kind) no trigger refers to | — | skipped, counted as a model element nothing refers to |
| SignalEvent whose signal is not written, TimeEvent whose `when` is not a number with a time unit | comment; the transition that refers to it drops the trigger | **unmapped** — the reason names the signal or the time |
| Interaction | a scenario `action def` on the owning block: each message in occurrence order as a step — a signal send `send new Sig(args) to this.part`, a `synchCall`/`asynchCall` of an operation `perform action x : Owner::Op ::> part.op { in p = arg; }` with the arguments bound to the `in` parameters by name or position, a `reply` an assignment of the call's `out` to the caller lifeline's attribute the reply's argument names | approximated (the lifelines' own behavior is not part of it; an `asynchCall` waits for the callee where v1 did not) |
| Lifeline | the feature path from the owning block to the part, port or reference it `represents`, through the parts and their types (`drive.motor`), or the interaction's `in` parameter | mapped |
| Lifeline with a `selector`, standing for an `out` parameter, a property no part of the owning block reaches or one reached along two paths, or for no ConnectableElement; Interaction owned by a Collaboration or by no block | comment: the whole interaction is refused | **unmapped** — the reason names the lifeline |
| CombinedFragment `alt`, `opt` | `action x { if <guard> { … } else { … } }` when every guard parses as a v2 expression whose names resolve | mapped |
| CombinedFragment `loop` | `for i in 1..n { … }` when `minint = maxint`, `while <guard> { … }` when the guard is unbounded; a guard with bounds is refused | mapped |
| CombinedFragment `par` | `fork x;` … `join xEnd;` around the operands | mapped |
| CombinedFragment `seq`, `strict` | the operands in order | mapped |
| CombinedFragment with a guard that does not parse or resolve, an `alt` with an unguarded operand before its last, or of another operator (`critical`, `neg`, `assert`, `ignore`, `consider`, `break`) | comment: the whole interaction is refused | **unmapped** — the reason quotes the guard or names the operator |
| Message `createMessage`, `deleteMessage`; a message without a signal or operation | comment where the step would go; the steps around it are written | **unmapped** — a part exists for as long as its owner does |
| Message binding no argument to a parameter or signal attribute that must hold a value (no default, lower bound above zero), or one whose argument is not written | comment: the whole interaction is refused | **unmapped** — the reason names the parameter or attribute |
| DurationConstraint on a message, or on the occurrences of two messages of a scenario | a wait before the message's step, `accept after lo [SI::s]` or `accept after RandomFunctions::uniform(lo, hi) [SI::s]` as for an action; between two messages, a wait before the later step when they are adjacent, else `fork`ed after the earlier step and `join`ed before the later one, so the steps between count toward the interval | approximated (a v2 send arrives at once; a tool's duration mode is a run setting) |
| DurationConstraint between two messages of a scenario whose steps lie in different fragments (one in an `alt` operand, the other outside it) | comment before the later step | **unmapped** — a wait forked in one fragment cannot be joined in another |
| Interaction with no message | comment naming what it records (state invariants under time constraints: a timing trace); DurationConstraint, TimeConstraint, observation on an interaction | **unmapped** — no scenario step performs it |
| OpaqueBehavior, FunctionBehavior | `calc def` with its parameters when its one body is a v2 expression whose names resolve or a JavaScript expression of the [subset](#the-opaque-language-subset) (`Math.max(a, b)` → `RealFunctions::max(a, b)`) of the type of its one return or output parameter — a behavior with several has no one result and is written as an `action def`; an `action def` whose body is the translated `assign` sequence when the script is statements; otherwise `action def` keeping the body as a comment and the report naming the token refused | mapped / approximated |
| Member a behavior owns that its body has no place for: a constraint, attribute, nested classifier, operation or nested behavior of an OpaqueBehavior, FunctionBehavior or Interaction, a port of an Activity or StateMachine | comment; a diagram showing it does not expose it | **unmapped** — the reason names the behavior kind and its body |
| Operation | `action def <Op>` owned by the owner, with its parameters; the `method` behavior is written as its body (an Activity as the flow, an OpaqueBehavior as expression or comment), its parameters standing for the operation's at the same position, direction and type under the operation's names; a method parameter matching none is declared and reported, since a call binds only the operation's; no method: `abstract action def`; an `action <op> : <Op>;` usage of the owner performs it, as a call on an object does | mapped |
| Operation `precondition`, `postcondition`, `bodyCondition` | `assert constraint { <expr> }` in the action def when the expression parses and resolves; otherwise a comment | mapped / approximated |
| Reception with a `signal` and an Activity `method` | `action def <Sig> { action receive accept sig : Sig; action run : <Method> { in p = sig.p; } first run then receive; }` on the `part def`, plus `perform action sig : <Sig>;`, so every object of the block runs it from creation and accepts the signal again after each: the signal's attributes bind the method's `in` parameters of the same name whose type they conform to and whose multiplicity holds theirs, defaulted and optional parameters stay unbound; a parameter that must hold a value no attribute supplies, or whose type or multiplicity the same-named attribute does not fit, leaves the method unrun, with the reason. Where the signal arrives at ports of the block over the document's connectors or declarations, a `fork` after `start` adds one such loop per port, `accept … : Sig via <port>;` | mapped (a required parameter unsupplied, or an attribute not fitting its parameter: approximated, the signal is only accepted) |
| Reception without a method, or whose method is not an Activity | the same performed `action def`, accepting the signal and accepting again; the method is named in the report | approximated |
| Reception whose signal is not written | comment | **unmapped** — the reason names the signal |
| «Unit», «QuantityKind» instance specifications | comment placeholder | **unmapped** — use the `SI`/`ISQ` libraries |
| Diagram | `view 'Name' { expose …; render Views::as…; }` in the body of the v2 element written for `ownerOfDiagram`, one `expose` per shown element that is written, the rendering chosen by the diagram's kind (see [Diagrams](#diagrams)) | mapped |
| Activity diagram of a behavior written as an `action def`; state machine diagram of one written as a `state def` | `view 'Name' : StandardViewDefinitions::ActionFlowView` / `StateTransitionView` exposing the definition, whose graph the rendering draws — its nodes and edges are drawn, not exposed one by one — and the shown elements from elsewhere; rendered `asInterconnectionDiagram` | mapped |

| Diagram whose owner has no v2 body (a region, a property, an enumeration, an action node, an activity that is inlined), names no owner, or names an id the document does not define | the view is written in the body of the nearest ancestor that has one — the state def a region belongs to, the part def a property is of, the action def (or the operation whose method it is) an action node belongs to, the package, or the document's top level — and the note says where | approximated |
| Diagram some of whose shown elements are not written (results, tool content, elements nothing refers to, states and action nodes, ids the document does not define), or that shows nothing | the written ones are exposed and the rest dropped, the note counting them; a view exposing nothing is still written, `view 'Name' { render …; }`, which validates, and the note says what the diagram draws — nothing at all, free symbols only, or elements the tool's list omits — when the archive's stream tells; a diagram of pasted pictures alone is a view drawing them (see [Pictures pasted onto a diagram](#pictures-pasted-onto-a-diagram)) | approximated |
| Diagram named like a member of the body it is written in — a «View» class's `view` usage of the same name in the same package, a state, an action | renamed `Name 2`, `Name 3`… past the taken names | approximated |
| Diagram with no representation serialized, or one naming no diagram type | a view of unknown kind, rendered `asTextualNotation`, exposing what the representation lists — nothing when there is none | approximated |
| Diagram no written element can hold: every ancestor is library content or otherwise unwritten | comment | **unmapped** |
| The standard profiles, the SysML/UML libraries themselves | — | skipped |
| The modeling tool's own profiles and their content, by exact namespace path: MagicDraw's SysML customization (`…/spec/Customization/…`), `DSL_Customization.xmi` («Customization» classes, «derivedPropertySpecification» properties and their structured-expression bodies), `UI_Prototyping_Profile.xmi` («Label», «Button», «GroupBox», … mockups), `SimulationProfile.xmi` classes other than run configurations («SequenceDiagramGeneratorConfig», …); a marked classifier with a standard stereotype or a behavior of its own is model content and migrates as such | — ; the reason names what the content configures | skipped |

The v1 element's `xmi:id` is kept as the reason a report line can be found in the source
model; the notation itself carries no IDs. Stable identity annotations for a re-migration are
future work (see [element identity annotations](../project/element-identity-annotations.md)).

Names that are not v2 identifiers — with spaces, punctuation, or starting with a digit — are
quoted (`'Vehicle Design'`).

### Diagrams

A diagram is a v2 `view`: what it shows is exposed, how it is drawn is not migrated (a layout
has no v2 form). The view is named after the diagram and written in the body of the v2
element `ownerOfDiagram` names — a `package`, or the `part def`, `state def`, `action def`,
`metadata def`… written for a classifier; for a behavior that is the method of an operation, the
operation's definition, whose body the behavior is written as, so the behavior's members are
exposed under the operation's name — and exposes, by qualified name, every shown element the
document writes; a shown element that is not written (a result snapshot,
tool content, an element nothing refers to, a state or an action node, which have no name of
their own outside their body) is dropped and counted in the note. A diagram showing nothing writable is still a view,
with no `expose`, so the model's inventory of diagrams is complete. Each `expose` names one
shown element by the qualified name the migrator writes elsewhere — `Package::Def::feature`,
never a package's `::**` — so a diagram of a package exposes the members it pictures, not
the package.

The view takes the diagram's name unless the body already has a member so named: a tool
names a view's diagram after the «View» class, a state's after the state, and both are
written in the same body, so the diagram's view is renamed `Name 2` (`Name 3`… past the taken
names) and the note says so. An «Expose» whose supplier is a diagram exposes the diagram's
view under that written name, qualified from the client view's body when the name alone would
not resolve to it. The diagram's documentation — the first comment the diagram itself owns
that annotates nothing but the diagram, which is how a tool serializes it — is the view's `doc`.

The `render` names one of the standard `Views` library's renderings, chosen from the
diagram's kind — the tool's `type` (`SysML Block Definition Diagram`, `Dependency Matrix`)
and `umlType` (`Class Diagram`) together — by the first family below a word of either names:

| Diagram kind | Rendering |
|---|---|
| a table or matrix: Generic, Instance and Requirement Tables, Dependency and Allocation Matrices, any kind named `… Table`/`… Matrix` | `Views::asElementTable` |
| internal block, parametric, composite structure and interconnection diagrams | `Views::asInterconnectionDiagram` |
| block definition, class, package, object, component, deployment, profile and other structure diagrams | `Views::asTreeDiagram` |
| an activity diagram whose owner is written as an `action def`, a state machine (or statechart) diagram whose owner is written as a `state def`, showing a node or edge of its graph | `view : StandardViewDefinitions::ActionFlowView` / `StateTransitionView`, rendered `Views::asInterconnectionDiagram` |
| other behavior diagrams (sequence, use case, an activity diagram of a package or one showing nothing of its activity's graph), requirement, content and free-form diagrams, a tool's own kinds, a diagram naming no kind | `Views::asTextualNotation` |

The rendering is written `$::Views::…` where a member named `Views` would shadow the library, a
view definition `$::StandardViewDefinitions::…` where one named `StandardViewDefinitions` would, and a
shown primitive is exposed as `$::ScalarValues::…` where a member named `ScalarValues` would.

A typed graph view exposes the definition whose graph it draws — the `action def` or `state def`
the diagram's owner, or the owner's nearest behavior ancestor (a region, an action node, a
composite state) is written in — in place of the shown nodes and edges of that graph, which the
rendering draws from the definition's body; shown elements from elsewhere (a block a swimlane
represents, a signal), and a shown edge of the graph the rendering does not draw (an object flow
from a parameter node, written as a `binding` an `ActionFlowView` has no edge for), are exposed as
in any view. The note names the definition and counts the nodes and edges drawn. A diagram of
the family that shows none of the graph — an empty one, or one showing only the behavior itself
— is not a graph view, since exposing the definition would draw what the diagram did not: it is
rendered `asTextualNotation`, exposing what it shows as any other diagram.

#### Edges a diagram shows

A view can only `expose` a member, and the migrator writes most edges anonymously — `first a then
b;`, `flow a.out to b.in;`, `transition first S accept Sig then T;`, `connect a to b;` — so a
diagram drawing one had nothing to name, and an MTIP route (below) nothing to attach to. An edge at
least one diagram shows is therefore written as a named member, its v1 name when it has one and
otherwise a name spelled from what it is written between, in the body it is written in:

| v1 edge shown by a diagram | named member |
|---|---|
| ControlFlow | `succession 'a to b' first a then b;` (`'start to b'` from an initial node, `if g` after the source as before); a decision's `else` branch, which v2 admits no name for, stays anonymous and is reported so |
| ObjectFlow between pins | `flow 'a.out to b.in' from a.out to b.in;`; several edges carrying one producer–pin pair share the one member, named when any of them is shown |
| ObjectFlow at a parameter | `binding 'p = a.out' bind p = a.out;` — exposable, but an `ActionFlowView` draws neither the parameter nor the binding, so its route is reported `not drawn` |
| Transition | `transition 'S accept Sig then T' first S accept Sig then T;` — the trigger, guard and target as written, the payload binding left out of the name; several triggers are several transitions, each named for its own trigger (a v1 name is numbered, `halt`, `halt2`), and the edge's route pins every one of them |
| Connector | `connection 'a.p to b.q' connect a.p to b.q;` |
| BindingConnector, delegation connector | `binding 'a.p = b.q' bind a.p = b.q;` |
| Dependency, Extend | `dependency 'A to B' from A to B;` (`allocation` for an «Allocate»); several clients or suppliers are several dependencies, one per pair, and the view exposes each |
| «Satisfy» | `satisfy requirement 'satisfy R' : R;` in the satisfying usage's owner, one per client in its own owner's body, and the view exposes each |
| «Verify» | `verify requirement 'verify R' : R;` in the test case's `objective`, which is named `objective` so the member can be qualified; one per pair, as for a «Satisfy» |
| Include, Message | already named members: `include use case x : X;`, the interaction step `action x …` |

The name is a spelling, not a value: it derives from the ends' written names, never from ids or
hashes, so it is stable across runs and readable in the view (`expose 'Wait accept QueryCompleted
then Retrieve Segment Config';`). A name the body already holds is numbered past the taken ones,
`'a to b 2'`, by the same helpers that dedupe every other member. An edge no diagram shows is
written as before, anonymous, so naming changes nothing in a model without diagrams; and naming
reads only the model's diagrams, never `-layout`, so the notation is the same with or without an
MTIP export. What a view can expose, anything can refer to: a state, a parallel state standing
for a region, and a transition written under its v1 name are members a qualified name reaches, so
a comment annotating one now says `about` it, diagrams or not — the comment is written once the
whole model is, so it names members declared after it. Naming an edge leaves it `mapped`:
the element is unchanged, and the report's target column now names the member.

Edges with no v2 member of their own are not given one: a Generalization or InterfaceRealization
is a `:>` clause or a port's conjugation, a Composition, Aggregation or Association between blocks
is the `part`/`ref` end usage, a constraint or information flow edge nothing realizes is not
written, and a decision's `else` branch or an initial transition is a clause of the node it leaves,
not a member. Their placements on a diagram expose the ends as before; their routes are reported
(below), not attached to a member that is not an edge.

#### Layout from an MTIP export

What a diagram's XMI does not carry is where it draws its elements; Cameo/MagicDraw keeps that
geometry outside the model. An [MTIP](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mtip-cameo) export of the same
project — its HUDS XML — holds it, and `-layout <mtip-export.xml>` joins it to the migration: the
model document stays the one source of structure and behavior, the export is an augment, never a
second input. Each of the export's diagram records joins a migrated diagram by the element
identifier both files share (the record's `id` is the model's `xmi:id`).

A record's element placements become `metadata DiagramLayout::Layout about <ref> { x; y; width;
height; }` in the view's body, and its connector routes `metadata DiagramLayout::Route about <ref>
{ points = (…); }`, qualified `$::DiagramLayout::` where a member shadows the library — the
geometry form [DiagramLayout](../project/diagram-layout-annotations.md) already defines, so every
rendering honors it. Cameo stores y negated (top at or below zero); the migration writes
`x = left`, `y = -top`, `width = right - left`, `height = top - bottom`, pixels y-down from the top
left, and a connector's waypoints source to target — client point, breakpoints reversed, supplier
point. `@DiagramLayout::Canvas { unit = "px"; width; height; }` sizes the canvas by the bounding
box of what the view writes, and is omitted when nothing is.

Geometry is written only for what the view draws: a placement whose element resolves and whose
`expose` the view carries, or which the graph a typed view exposes draws as a node (a state's
inline `entry`, `do` or `exit` action is listed inside the state's node, and an internal
transition Cameo places as text in its state's box is an edge to the rendering, so their
placements are counted as not exposed rather than pinned to a node the rendering never draws); a route whose
connector's element is written as a named member (see [Edges a diagram shows](#edges-a-diagram-shows))
that the view exposes, or that its graph draws, *and* that the view's rendering draws as an edge —
a succession or flow in an `ActionFlowView`, a transition in a `StateTransitionView`, a connection
or binding `asInterconnectionDiagram`. A route for an edge the rendering does not draw (a dependency,
satisfy or include on a tree diagram, a message step) is not written: the geometry would pin
nothing. Everything else is counted, not dropped: the report's `layout`
summary section and each diagram's note say how many shown elements were positioned, how many were
not exposed, and how many resolved to no element; the routes are itemized by the connector's v1 kind
and what became of each — `written`, `no v2 member`, `not written`, `unnamed`, `not drawn`,
`not exposed`, `duplicate`, `dangling` — in the report (`# routes of Transition: 2 written`) and
the results sidecar's `routesByKind`; an export record matching no diagram of the model,
or one the migration does not write as a view, and each malformed record is an `unmapped` report row; a presentation property `DiagramLayout` has
no attribute for (a color, a font, an image) is counted by tag and dropped rather than invented.
Views the export does not cover are a normal case of export scope and are reported as a count;
they are laid out from their diagram's own symbol stream instead, as is every element a joined
record neither places nor routes (the export wins per element, the stream fills in the rest, and
the diagram's layout note and the summary's `streamSupplemented` count say when it did). A
`-layout` file exported from a different project — no record joins — or one that is not a HUDS
`<packet>` at all refuses with the mismatch stated; without `-layout` every diagram is laid out
from its own stream alone. A symbol the stream keeps but does not draw (`visible` false), with
every symbol nested in it and every part, region or compartment row it lists, shows nothing: the
view does not expose its element for it, it takes no position or style, and a hidden frame does
not bound the diagram. A symbol's position and style go to the element it names itself, not to
the last part or region listed under it.

#### Pictures pasted onto a diagram

A picture pasted onto a Cameo diagram is an `ImageShape` symbol of the diagram's stream that
stands for no model element. MagicDraw serializes the picture's own bytes into the symbol's
`<image>` tag as space-separated hexadecimal octets without zero padding (`89 50 4e 47 d a 1a a`
opens a PNG), and keeps in the symbol's `IMAGE` file property only the name of the file the
picture was pasted from — that file is not in the archive. The migration decodes the octets,
recognizes the content type from the bytes (PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, WebP, or SVG when the text is
one well-formed SVG document — a single `svg` root in the SVG namespace; markup that is not is
no image, and the report says why: `no SVG document: a <doc> document`), and writes them
beside the notation under `images/` as the pasted file's base name with the type's suffix
(`Screen Shot.png` holding PNG bytes is `images/Screen_Shot.png`; a symbol with no file name is
named by its symbol id), the same bytes pasted onto several diagrams written once, through the
same `-o` requirement and dedup as a document's attached images. The view then draws the
picture where Cameo drew it: `@DiagramLayout::Picture { location = "images/<name>.png"; x; y;
width; height; alt = "<file name>"; }` in the view's body, in stream order under the element
symbols, or `above = true` when an element symbol drawn before it in the stream lies under it —
Cameo draws later symbols on top — or when it overlaps an earlier picture drawn over them and no
element symbol drawn after it, so that it stays over that picture. A `Picture` lies either under or
over every element symbol it overlaps, so a picture pasted over one symbol and under another
drawn after it is written under both: the element symbols stay visible, the diagram is
approximated, and its note says so (`1 pasted image drawn under the 1 element symbol it lay
over, since symbols drawn after it lie over it`) — likewise when a picture drawn over the element
symbols covers a later one they in turn cover (`drawn under the 1 pasted image it lay over`). A
symbol without area (a zero or negative width or height) is not written: `has no area to fill
(0 by -40)`. A diagram of pictures alone becomes a view exposing nothing
that draws them, so a document figure of it shows the pictures under the diagram's name as
caption, through the same `Diagram` block as a figure of any other view; there is no separate
`Image` block for it, so a hand-written view carrying a `Picture` and a migrated one render the
same way. A symbol carrying a file name and no bytes is a picture the archive does not hold —
the report names the file and the view draws nothing for it, as before; bytes that do not read
as octets are an `unmapped` row for the symbol saying which octet is not hexadecimal, and the
symbol is read without them. A picture pasted onto a table or matrix is written and annotated
the same way, but a view rendered `asElementTable` draws no picture: the diagram is
approximated, its note says so (`1 pasted image written as images/Plant.png, which a view
rendered asElementTable does not draw`), and the rendering's notices state where the picture
would have been. Each diagram's note says what was written (`1 pasted image written as
images/Plant.png`) or why not, and the report's summary counts the pictures written and drawn
(`# pasted images: 3 of 6 written as files and drawn by the view, 1 written on a view whose table
rendering does not draw them`) with the image files.

### Tables, matrices and relation maps

A Cameo/MagicDraw table is a diagram with a definition: the «InstanceTable», «DiagramTable»
(generic table) or «RelationMap» stereotype of the MagicDraw profile
(`http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/20131001/MagicDrawProfile`), or the «DependencyMatrix» of the
Dependency Matrix profile (`http://www.magicdraw.com/schemas/Dependency_Matrix_Profile.xmi`)
with the «MatrixFilter» application naming the same diagram, applied to the `uml:Diagram`.
The [view](#diagrams) is still written for the diagram; the definition is written beside it,
in the same body, as an executable query and a renderable document:

```sysml
view 'Pump Table' {
    expose p1;
    expose p2;
    expose 'Pump Table Document';
    render Views::asElementTable;
}
calc def 'Pump Table Rows' :> DocumentQueries::Query {
    DocumentQueries::Project(
        source = DocumentQueries::OrderBy(
            source = DocumentQueries::WhereFeature(
                source = DocumentQueries::WhereType(
                    source = DocumentQueries::WhereType(
                        source = DocumentQueries::Union(
                            source = DocumentQueries::Descendants(
                                source = DocumentQueries::Named(qualifiedName = ("Plant::Inventory"))),
                            other = DocumentQueries::Named(qualifiedName = ("Plant::Spares::s1", "Plant::Spares::s2"))),
                        type = ("Plant::Structure::Pump")),
                    type = ("Definition")),
                'feature' = "isIndividual", operator = "=", value = "true"),
            property = "mass", direction = "descending", missing = "last", multiple = "first"),
        properties = ("name"),
        columns = (DocumentQueries::Column(name = "mass", expression = Plant::Structure::Pump::mass ?? "")))
}
part def 'Pump Table Document' :> DocumentQueries::Document {
    attribute redefines title = "Pump Table";
    part rows : DocumentQueries::Table {
        attribute redefines caption = "Pump Table";
        calc rows : 'Pump Table Rows';
    }
}
```

The query is a `calc def` specializing `DocumentQueries::Query`, named `<Diagram> Rows`, and the
document a `part def` specializing `DocumentQueries::Document`, named `<Diagram> Document`
(`Name 2`… past a taken name); the view exposes the document, so `-render-document
Plant::Inventory::'Pump Table Document'` renders the table and `-run-query` its rows. Only
the exact profile namespaces define a table: a user stereotype named `InstanceTable` or
`TableStructure` under any other URI is ordinary [user-profile](#profiles-and-stereotypes)
metadata, and a look-alike application from an unbundled profile stays a comment. The
[query cookbook](../manual/query-cookbook.md) documents every operation; the table's parts map:

| Table definition | Query |
|---|---|
| `scope` (the packages or classifiers whose subtree the table lists); `takeWholeModelAsScope` | `Descendants(source = Named(qualifiedName = (…)))`, unbounded; the whole model is the union of the top-level members and their descendants |
| `rowElements`, `additionalElements` (explicit rows) | one `Union(source = Named(qualifiedName = (row, row, …)), other = <scope>)`, the rows in their v1 order ahead of the scope's other elements, so an unsorted table — and each level of a tree — keeps the order the tool listed them in |
| `excludedElements` | `Except(source = <rows>, exclude = Named(qualifiedName = (…)))` ahead of the sort, the row noted with their count; an excluded element that resolves to nothing, or that the migration does not write, is absent regardless and the note says so; the rows nested under an excluded row stay, as they do in the tool, which lists each row it hides by itself |
| `displayMode` — `List`, `Compact tree` or `Complete tree`, the literals of the MagicDraw profile's `TableDisplayMode` enumeration — with `showScopeAsRoot` and `expandedRows` | a list stays flat; `Compact tree` wraps the sorted rows in `Tree(source = <rows>)`, which nests each row under the nearest row containing it at the depth the renderers indent by ([hierarchical rows](../manual/outputs.md#hierarchical-rows)), so a nested row's `name` cell is the element's own name (a dotted name the tool gave a nested instance stays as written) and its depth is structural, never spaces in the name; `Complete tree` adds `ancestors = Descendants(source = <scope>)`, so the scope's elements containing the rows join as intermediate levels; `showScopeAsRoot = true` adds the scope itself to the ancestors, as the root (noted, not applied, for a flat list or a table naming no scope). A mode the profile does not define lists the rows flat with the note; `expandedRows` records which nodes the tool had unfolded (`NoExpanded` when none was), which is window state, so every nested row is listed, with the note; an entry not of the form `<level>,<id>` is dropped with the note, not a refusal |
| an instance table's `classifiers` | `WhereType(type = (<the classifiers' v2 names>))`, then `WhereType(type = "Definition")` and `WhereFeature('feature' = "isIndividual", operator = "=", value = "true")`, so the rows are the individual definitions the instance specifications became — of the classifier and, as in Cameo, of its subtypes — and not the slots typed by them; `includeSubtypesOfRowTypes = false` is approximated with the note that subtypes are listed too |
| a generic table's `rowElementType` — a UML metaclass or a stereotype | `WhereType` on the v2 kind the metaclass or a standard stereotype [maps to](#mapping) (`Class` and «Block» → `PartDefinition`, «Requirement» → `RequirementDefinition`…); the abstract metaclasses list what they hold in UML, so `Type` and `Classifier` are every `Definition` plus the `ViewUsage`/`ViewpointUsage` a «View»/«Viewpoint» class became, `Namespace` adds `Package` and `StateUsage`, and `PackageableElement` adds `Package` and the dependencies — never the features a classifier owns; `Element` and `NamedElement` alone admit everything; a user stereotype the migration writes as a `metadata def` → `WhereMetadata('metadata' = (…))`, which honors specializations |
| `columnIds` `QPROP:Element:name`, `documentation`, `qualifiedName`, `owner`, `Id`, `Text`, `classifier` | `Project(properties = (…))`, in column order — `Project` lists its properties ahead of its computed columns, so a table interleaving a tag column among these is reordered, with the note: `Id` reads `shortName` and `Text` `documentation`, since a «Requirement»'s `Id` and `Text` tags are written as the requirement def's short name and `doc` — a row that is no requirement has an empty cell under either, as it has in the tool, the element's identity being the `ID` column (`@id`); `classifier` reads `general`, the row's type by name; each column is headed by the tool's property name (`Id`, `Text`, `classifier`) through `Table.columnLabels`, the query property staying the column's name; `hideColumns` omits a column, the tool's own columns (`_NUMBER_`, `PROPERTY_COLUMN`, `VALUE_COLUMN`, `MARGIN_COLUMN`) are omitted silently, and other tool properties are omitted with the note |
| `columnIds` `QPROP:stereotypeTags:<<Profile::Stereotype>>.tag` — a stereotype tag | a standard «Requirement» tag as the property above; a user stereotype's tag as `Column(name = "<tag>", expression = <Profile>::<Stereotype>::<tag> ?? "")` over the feature of the `metadata def` the stereotype [became](#profiles-and-stereotypes), which reads what the row's applications bind it to — every value of a multi-valued tag, as one multi-valued cell, an enumeration literal by its name, as every element cell prints; a tag of a stereotype the migration does not write (library content), or one the archive does not define, is omitted with the reason; the same tag listed twice is two columns, the second named `<tag> 2` but headed `<tag>` like the first, since column names are unique and headings need not be |
| `columnWidth` (`-1` = automatic) | `Table.columnWidths`, one entry per projected column in `Project`'s order, `0` for automatic, a width staying with the column it was stated on when `Project` reorders; the renderers honour them proportionally ([Column widths](../manual/authoring.md#column-widths)); a width that is not a whole number is read as automatic, with the note |
| the columns' headings | `Table.columnLabels`, one entry per projected column in `Project`'s order, `""` where the heading is the column's name ([Column labels](../manual/authoring.md#column-labels)): the tool's property name over a built-in column, the tag's name over a stereotype-tag column, a DocGen column's `titles` over a property column, the caption a renamed column keeps |
| the saved row filter — `SAVE_FILTER_VALUE = true` with `OPTION_FILTER_SEARCHING_TEXT`, `OPTION_FILTER_COLUMN_INDEXES` and the `OPTION_FILTER_*` flags among the diagram's properties | `WhereText(source = <projected rows>, columns = (…), operator = "matches", value = "<pattern>")` after `Project`, since the tool applies its filter box to the rows it lists, explicit ones and exclusions included: the text as a literal, wildcard (`*`, `?`) or regular-expression pattern as the flags say, case-folded unless case-sensitive, anchored by the from-start/from-end flags. `OPTION_FILTER_COLUMN_INDEXES` is a `ChoiceProperty`: its `<value>` (`0^1^3`) is the selection, counting the shown columns from 0, each mapped to the projected column reading it — an empty value, the tool's default, searches every column — while its `<choice>` elements only list the indexes offered; an index of a column the query does not read is noted, and a filter every one of whose selected columns the query does not read is dropped with the note, since the tool searched only those columns. A filter not saved with the table (`SAVE_FILTER_VALUE` absent or `false`) is window state and is not applied; a pattern Go's regular expressions do not compile is dropped with the note, and so is a filter whose column selection is not indexes joined by `^` — the selection is not read as every column |
| `columnIds` `IColumn:<property>` — a value property of the row classifier | `Column(name = "<property>", expression = <Def>::<property> ?? "")`, an empty cell where a row has no slot, as the tool draws it; the property is kept reachable (never written private) because the column names it |
| built-in and value-property columns interleaved (`name`, `mass`, `qualifiedName`) | `Project(properties = ("name", "qualifiedName"), columns = (Column(…)))` — `Project` lists its properties before its columns, so the built-in columns move ahead of the value properties; approximated with the note. Column names are unique: the built-in properties claim theirs first, and a value property captioned like one (`Pump::name`) is written `name 2` with the note |
| `sort` `<column>^Asc` / `^Desc` | `OrderBy(property, direction, missing = "last", multiple = "first")` — empty cells last and the first value of a multi-valued slot, the tool's own ordering; `-1`/`_EMPTY_` is no sort, a sort by tool identity is dropped with the note |
| a matrix's `rowScope`/`rowElementType` and `columnScope`/`columnElementType` | the rows are the row query; each `dependencyCriteria` becomes a `RelatedColumn(name, relationshipKind, direction, maxDepth = 1, aggregate = "list", targets = <column query>)`, whose cell lists the column elements the row is related to; `Row to column` is `"outgoing"`, `Column to row` `"incoming"` — the other way round for «DeriveReqt», whose v2 `derivation` runs from the original requirement to the derived one where the v1 dependency runs from the derived to the original — `Both` two columns (approximated); a second criterion with the same name is `Name 2` |
| a relation map's `contextElement`, `relationCriterion`, `depth`, `elementTypes` | `RelatedElements(source = Named(…), relationshipKind, direction, maxDepth = depth)` (0 = unbounded) filtered by `WhereType` over the element types, projected as `qualifiedName` and `@type` |

A criterion is a relationship walk only for the kinds `RelatedElements` knows: «Satisfy»,
«Verify», «Refine», «DeriveReqt», «Allocate» and UML `Generalization` (`specialization`); a
`Dependency`, an import, a user-profile relationship, a metachain or an OCL expression is
refused with the criterion named. A criterion's `includeSubtypes` has no query spelling: a
user stereotype specializing «Satisfy» is written as the same `satisfy`, so a walk of the kind
lists its relationships whether or not the criterion included subtypes. A criterion excluding
them is exact while the archive applies no such stereotype, and approximated — the stereotypes
named — when it does. Refused too is a table whose serialization is malformed — a `scope`
resolving to no element (a bare module id resolves through the href the document referenced
the element by; one that elements of several modules share names no element, and the refusal
lists the hrefs), a `sort` not of the form `<column>^Asc|Desc`, a `depth` that is not a
whole number, an instance table naming no classifier, a matrix with no filter, a criterion
whose XML does not parse — with every fault stated at once. A refused table is an `unmapped`
report row and a `not migrated` comment beside its view, which is still written; the rest of the
model is unaffected. A setting that only draws the table — a `columnWidth` that is not a number,
an `expandedRows` entry not of the form `<level>,<id>` — does not refuse it: the table is read
without the setting, and the report row notes what the tool wrote. The presentation settings the table's rendering depends on — exclusions,
display mode, scope root, column widths, the saved row filter — are applied as the table above
says, the report row stating each; the ones that only draw it in the tool (colors, `legend`,
`rowsOrder`, `expandedRows`, the number and margin columns) are dropped without one. A [DocGen
document](#docgen-documents) whose step draws the table's diagram embeds the same `Table` over
the same `… Rows` query — the query is written once, beside the view — so the section and the
standalone document render the same columns and cells.

### DocGen documents

An [MDK](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk) DocGen document — a class stereotyped «Document» of
the Document profile (`http://www.magicdraw.com/schemas/manual/Document_Profile.xmi`; the
collaborator profile beside it holds the paragraphs) — is a tree of «view» classes, each
conforming to a viewpoint whose method activity says what the view shows. It is written, beside
the class, as a `part def '<Name> Document' :> DocumentQueries::Document` whose sections are
the view tree in declaration order, and each view's method is lowered into the section's
content, so `-render-document` produces the document DocGen would have. A section opens, as
DocGen prints it, with the view's own documentation as a `Paragraph` — the same comment its
`view` carries as `doc`, tool HTML reduced to text — before its method's content, unless that
comment is shown by one of the view's collaborator paragraphs, in which case it is written once, in
that paragraph's place; a collaborator paragraph that cannot be shown (a malformed application) is
refused as usual and does not hide the documentation. A view with no «Conform» gets
DocGen's default behavior, that of MDK's
[`DocumentGenerator.parseView`](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/openmbee/mdk/generator/DocumentGenerator.java)
when the view has no viewpoint or method: a view that is itself a diagram shows its own figure, and any other shows,
after its documentation, each diagram it exposes or imports in that order — an `Image` of a
plain diagram, the `Table` of a table diagram — and nothing for an exposed element that is not
a diagram; the view's report row says the default applied and what it showed. Only the
«Conform» generalization decides, as it does in `parseView`: the «View» stereotype's `viewpoint`
tag, which the «View» row above writes as a `satisfy`, names no method for the section. A view whose «Conform» names no element of the export is refused with that reason rather
than given the default, and a view whose «Conform» names a viewpoint keeps its method's refusal
when that method is malformed. The tree
is the one DocGen walks: every property of a view typed by a view is a section, and a view is entered
for its own sections only through a composite or shared property — a plain reference places
the view as a section without its children, and the «Expose» dependencies of a property feed
its view only when the property is composite.

```sysml
part def 'Fleet Handbook Document' :> DocumentQueries::Document {
    attribute redefines title = "Fleet Handbook";
    part Requirements : DocumentQueries::Section {
        attribute redefines title = "Requirements";
        part paragraph : DocumentQueries::Paragraph {
            attribute redefines text = "Every truck of the fleet satisfies these requirements.";
        }
        part list : DocumentQueries::List {
            attribute redefines style = "number";
            calc items : 'Fleet Handbook Requirement List Rows';
        }
        part Safety : DocumentQueries::Section { … }
    }
    part Figures : DocumentQueries::Section {
        attribute redefines title = "Figures";
        part diagram : DocumentQueries::Diagram {
            attribute redefines caption = "Truck Structure";
            ref redefines source = Fleet::Structure::'Truck Structure';
        }
        part paragraph : DocumentQueries::Paragraph {
            attribute redefines text = "The truck and what it hauls";
        }
    }
}
```

The method activity is walked from its initial node along control flow — object flows between
pins carry data and are not followed; forks whose branches rejoin are walked branch by branch.
The «Expose» suppliers (and the view's element and package imports) are the chain's root,
`Named(qualifiedName = (…))`, each once however many times it is exposed, and each collect,
filter and sort step wraps the query so far; each presentation step ends one
`calc def '<Document> <Title> Rows' :> Query` beside the document and one content part in the
section, in the activity's order:

| DocGen step | Query or content |
|---|---|
| `CollectOwnedElements(depth)`, `CollectOwners(depth)` | `Descendants` / `Ancestors(source, maxDepth = depth)`; `depth` 0 or absent is unbounded |
| `CollectByDirectedRelationshipStereotypes(stereotypes, directionOut, depth)` | one `RelatedElements(relationshipKind, direction, maxDepth)` per stereotype the kinds above cover, `Union`ed |
| `CollectByAssociation(associationType, depth)` | the types of the collected classifiers' attributes of that aggregation kind (`composite` when none is named), followed on to `depth`, are known from the source model and named, `Named(qualifiedName = (…))`; a type that is not written is left out with the note, and a chain whose elements are known only when the query runs is refused, since no query operation tells a composite feature from a shared one |
| `CollectThingsOnDiagram` | the elements the collected diagrams show, `Named(qualifiedName = (…))`; a shown element the archive does not describe, that is not written, or that is written inside its owner with no v2 element of its own (a connector end) is left out with the note; a diagram whose content the archive does not record — no stream and no list, or a stream it names but does not hold or holds unreadable, whatever the list names — leaves the whole collection unknown, so the step is refused rather than named from the list and the other diagrams as if complete; a diagram that lists elements and names no stream is read as listed, with the note that the list need not be all it shows |
| `FilterByMetaclasses`, `FilterByStereotypes` | `WhereType` on the v2 kinds, or `WhereMetadata` for a user stereotype written as a `metadata def`; `include = false` is `Except(source, exclude = …)`; `considerDerived = false` is approximated, since `WhereMetadata` honors specializations; a stereotype with neither a v2 metaclass nor a `metadata def` is refused |
| `FilterByDiagramType(diagramTypes)` | keeps, among the collected diagrams, those whose diagram type (the tool's presentation type, `SysML Block Definition Diagram`, `SysML Internal Block Diagram`, …) is named, or the others when `include = false`; a diagram whose type the archive does not record leaves the result approximated, since the filter may keep or drop it |
| `FilterByNames(names)` | one `WhereName(operator = "matches", value = "^(?:<pattern>)$\|^(?:<pattern>)$\|…")` keeping the elements in their order; every pattern must compile as an RE2 regular expression. The filter reads the v1 name, as DocGen does, so where a collected element's v1 and v2 names fall on different sides of the pattern — an anonymous block the write names `unnamed` — the elements it keeps are named, `Named(qualifiedName = (…))`, with the note, since `WhereName` would read the v2 name |
| `SortByName`, `SortByAttribute(Name / Documentation)` | `OrderBy(property = "name" / "documentation", …)`, `reverse` descending |
| a fork whose branches rejoin at `Union` | `Union` of the branches' queries; the doubt a step before the fork leaves (a diagram type or content the archive does not record) is carried on by the branches that keep its result and ended by those that name their own targets, so the rejoined step knows what it draws when every branch does; a rejoin by `Intersection` or `XOR` is refused, and `RemoveDuplicates` is implicit in every operation and dropped |
| `CollectionAndFilterGroup`, `StructuredQuery` | the group's chain, inlined |
| `TableStructure` with `TableAttributeColumn` (`Name`, `Documentation`), `TablePropertyColumn` (a value property of the rows' definition, or a requirement's `Id`/`Text`), `TableExpressionColumn` naming a bare query property | `part table : Table { attribute redefines caption = …; calc rows : …; }` over `Project(properties, columns = (Column(…)))`, the built-in properties first (a built-in column behind a value property is moved ahead of it with the note) and a value property captioned like a built-in property as `<caption> 2`; a requirement's `Id` is its `shortName` and its `Text` its `documentation`, where the migration writes them; `includeDoc` adds `documentation`; a `MonteCarloAnalysis` statistic column (`N`, `Mean`, `Deviation`, `OutOfSpec`) reads the statistic the row's nested analysis records, as `Column(name = "N", expression = 'Monte Carlo'.runs)` and a sort on it as `OrderBy(property = "'Monte Carlo'.runs")`, when an instance the table lists records it — otherwise the column is omitted with the note saying so; a column beyond these — a property of a used project — is omitted with the note saying which, and a table with no writable column is refused. The caption is the table's title (`titles`, between `titlePrefix` and `titleSuffix`), and its `captions` text follows the table as a `Paragraph` unless `showCaptions` is false |
| `BulletedList(orderedList, includeDoc)` | `part list : List { attribute redefines style = "number" / "bullet"; calc items : …; }`; `includeDoc` follows each item's name with its documentation |
| `Paragraph(body)`; a «CollaboratorParagraph» reading the comment body | `part paragraph : Paragraph { attribute redefines text = "…"; }`, tool HTML reduced to text; a paragraph over the targets' documentation is `calc values : …` over `Project(properties = ("documentation"))`. A collaborator paragraph stands where its `siblingId` (else `parentId`) tag puts it: one naming another paragraph of the view follows that paragraph; one with no tag comes, as Cameo prints it, before the content the method generates; one naming the generated figure of a diagram, `Containment_DiagramMainImage__<id>`, follows the figure or table the section drew for that diagram, or the refusal standing where it would have been. An anchor of that form naming no diagram of the model (Collaborator writes publish-time ids) is placed after the section's only figure when it draws exactly one and no other anchor is as unresolved, the row saying so; otherwise, and for an anchor of another kind (`Containment_<Kind>__…`) or a tag naming nothing, the paragraph follows the generated content and its row names the anchor and why |
| a «CollaboratorImageParagraph» — a comment stereotyped MagicDraw «AttachedFile», or one carrying an `<img>` | `part 'image N' : Image { attribute redefines location = "images/<file>"; attribute redefines caption = "<comment text>"; attribute redefines alt = "<file>"; }`, and the attached bytes are written beside the notation under `images/`, as the base of the file name with the suffix the bytes' content type calls for — `figure.txt` holding PNG bytes is `images/figure.png` (an `http(s)` source names the URL instead and writes no file; the comment body is the caption and an empty one is allowed). The attachment is found in the archive by the `ATTACHED_FILE` extension's stream id, then the `file` tag name or an entry with that base name; an image no archive entry holds keeps its caption as a paragraph, noted, and a captionless one is **unmapped** — the note names the file. A server-relative `src` (a path the View Editor serves) resolves against `-image-base-url`; without it the paragraph keeps its text with the same note saying so. Writing the files requires `-o`; `images/` beside the model is the migration's, so a re-run replaces the files it wrote before as it replaces the model, and a file of another name there is left alone — a run never writes over the model it is writing, the input, or its `-migration-report`/`-migration-results` files |
| an `Image` step over a diagram that draws nothing, whose note (the diagram's own comment) holds an `<img>` | `part image : Image { attribute redefines location = <resolved src>; attribute redefines caption = <the figure's title>; attribute redefines alt = <img alt>; }` instead of leaving the figure out — approximated, since layout and free symbols drop; a note that says more than the title follows as the caption paragraph; the note's image not in the archive and not resolved against `-image-base-url` leaves the figure out with the same hint |
| `Image` | one `part diagram : Diagram { attribute redefines caption = "<title>"; ref redefines source = <its view>; }` per diagram the chain collected (see below), captioned by its `titles` entry (else the diagram's name) between `titlePrefix` and `titleSuffix`, its `captions` entry following as a `Paragraph` unless `showCaptions` is false. A diagram that is a Cameo [table, matrix or relation map](#tables-matrices-and-relation-maps) is shown as DocGen shows it, as the table: `part table : Table { attribute redefines caption = "<title>"; calc rows : <its '… Rows' query>; }` over the query its definition already lowered, written once beside the view, never as a `Diagram` of the view rendered `asElementTable` (which a document would draw as a listing of the view's members); the step's row says the diagram is written as a Table over that query, and `-doc-number-figures` counts it among the tables. A table whose definition is refused (no query form) is refused in its place, the reason given, rather than drawn as that listing. A diagram written as a graph view — an activity diagram as an `ActionFlowView`, a state machine diagram as a `StateTransitionView` — is drawn like any other; one whose view renders as textual notation (a sequence diagram, whose Interaction is written as a scenario and not as the occurrence parts a `SequenceView` draws; an activity or state machine diagram whose behavior is not written as a definition) is refused with the reason, since a document draws no text view. A diagram that shows nothing — its tool lists no element and its stream draws nothing, or free symbols only (a diagram of pasted pictures draws them, so its figure is written) — would be an empty figure, so no `Diagram` is written for it: the step is reported mapped (approximated when the archive cannot tell what it shows) with the reason, and its caption stays as a paragraph, as DocGen shows it. An `Image` whose chain holds no diagram is mapped as drawing nothing, the note saying what the chain held instead |
| `Dynamic View` | a nested `Section` with the called activity's title, lowered the same way; an activity that calls itself is refused, since a recursive section has no static spelling |

The diagrams among the collected elements are no query's rows — a migrated diagram is a view —
but each step transforms them beside the query so an `Image` shows what the chain kept, as
DocGen's does: the chain starts on the diagrams the view exposes or the node targets, and
follows the source elements it collects so that `CollectOwnedElements` gathers the diagrams
they own (to `depth`) — the way DocGen finds the figures of an exposed package or block — a
name filter matches the diagram's name, a metaclass or stereotype filter keeps a diagram for
`Element`, `NamedElement`, `Diagram` or the stereotype that is its diagram type,
`FilterByDiagramType` keeps those of the types named, a sort orders them and the source
elements they are collected from as `OrderBy` orders its rows — by name, or by the `doc` the
migrated declaration carries (a diagram's is its own comment), those without one last, ties
in place — a rejoin unites the branches'
diagrams once each, `CollectOwners` adds the diagrams' owners to the query as
`Named(qualifiedName = (…))`, `CollectThingsOnDiagram` reads what they show, and any other
collect drops them. An `Image` after a filter that kept no diagram draws nothing and the
report says which filter emptied it; one after a step whose result is known only when the
query runs is refused, since which diagrams it would draw is not known, and so is one after a
step with no query spelling, as every other presentation step downstream of it is.

A UML Constraint on a «Document» or «View» class whose specification is a `uml:Expression`
tree with no symbol whose every operand is an `InstanceValue` naming no instance (a
collaborator's presentation constraint) spells nothing, and is skipped as notation-only rather
than refused; this is the expression translator's rule for such a tree wherever it stands (see
[Mapping](#mapping)), not a document rule.

A step with no query spelling — `CollectTypes`, `SortByAttribute(Value)`, `SortByProperty`,
a `*ByExpression` or
`TableExpressionColumn` beyond a bare query property (`owner.name`, `allInstances()`, OCL), a
`CollectFilterUserScript`, a user script — is refused with the offending construct quoted,
and so is every presentation step downstream of it, while the section and its independent
siblings are still written. A malformed document — a view whose `Conform` names no viewpoint,
a viewpoint whose `method` names no element or one that is not an activity, a method with no
initial node or a dangling control flow, a `depth` that is not a whole number, a
collaborator paragraph whose `viewId` or `ownerId` names no view, an empty paragraph — is
reported the same way. Where a model member named `DocumentQueries` would shadow the library,
every reference is written `$::DocumentQueries::…`. A section, paragraph, table, list or diagram
block declares members of its own (`title`, `rows`, the nested sections), and a reference written
inside it is qualified past whichever of those it would otherwise resolve to — a section named
like a top-level package names that package's view as `$::<package>::…`.

#### Rendering a migrated document

A migrated document is rendered as any other, by its qualified name (see
[Rendering a document as HTML](cli.md#rendering-a-document-as-html) and
[as PDF](cli.md#rendering-a-document-as-pdf)):

```bash
sysml Model.sysml -render-document "'Model Documents'::'Design Document'" -o design.md
sysml Model.sysml -render-document "'Model Documents'::'Design Document'" -doc-form html \
    -doc-title-page -doc-toc -doc-number-sections -o design.html
sysml Model.sysml -render-document "'Model Documents'::'Design Document'" -doc-form pdf \
    -doc-title-page -doc-toc -doc-number-sections -o design.pdf
```

What DocGen adds around a document's content — a title page, a table of contents and numbered
headings — is no part of the DocGen model and none of a `Document`'s: it is asked of the run,
with `-doc-title-page`, `-doc-toc` and `-doc-number-sections`, and shapes the HTML page and the
PDF alike: the title on a page of its own, a `Contents` section listing every section by number,
and headings numbered by nesting, `1`, `1.1`, `1.1.1`. Markdown has no page shell to put them in
and refuses the three, so `-doc-form markdown` writes the title as its first heading and the
section tree as nested headings, unnumbered. The rendered figures are the migrated views: a
block or internal block diagram drawn from its exposures, an activity or state machine diagram
drawn from its graph, each positioned where the MTIP layout put it when `-layout` was given
(see [Layout from an MTIP export](#layout-from-an-mtip-export)) — and showing, in every
`-diagram-form`, the elements the layout placed: an exposed package the source diagram did not
draw stays out of the figure rather than expanding into its whole contents, and
`-render-unplaced strip` adds the unplaced elements; a diagram the
migration left out of the document (empty, or rendered as textual notation) is absent from the
render and the report says why, so a rendered document holds no empty figure. A table cell over
a multi-valued slot (`attribute :>> tCalibNB = (69.0, 98.0);` under a column declared `[0..*]`)
lists its values in order, `69, 98`, as DocGen's did, and one over a slot with no value is empty.
Styling beyond what the model carries — a cover image, a tool's fonts, its header and footer —
is not invented; `-html-theme` and `-html-css` take a stylesheet of your own.

The whole set of a model's documents is rendered with `-render-documents <dir>` (see
[the CLI reference](cli.md#rendering-a-view)): every document in one directory, linked to one
another. A model whose documents repeat a short name across packages — DocGen templates
instantiated in several places — renders each to its own file, since the file is named by the
qualified name; naming one of them to `-render-document` by the short name alone is refused
with the qualified name of every candidate. A document that cannot be rendered does not stop the
set: the others are written, a page stating the error stands in for it, and the run lists each
such document and exits `3`.

The mapping has been run over the XMI of the [OpenMBEE TMT SysML model](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/TMT-SysML-Model)
(27 MB; 44,600 elements once the nodes and edges of its behaviors are counted): it writes 7 MB
of notation that passes the gate below in a few seconds, and its Turtle in a few more. Five
elements in six map or are approximated; the unmapped rest is dominated by absolute and
unparseable time events, call actions that call no behavior, simulation verdicts stored in
slots of constraint properties, and dependencies whose other end is outside the document.

## Profiles and stereotypes

A v1 model's profile layer — the `uml:Profile`s it defines, the `uml:Stereotype`s in them and
the applications (`<Org:Org_Requirement base_Class="…" Rationale="…"/>`) — is read as three
kinds of provenance, each written differently.

**Standard profiles** (OMG SysML and UML, in the OMG or Papyrus namespaces, and the copies a
tool bundles under `SysML`/`UML Standard Profile` roots) classify: «Block» makes a `part def`,
«Requirement» a `requirement def`, and so on through the mapping table. The profiles themselves
are skipped; v2 has the constructs.

**The modeling tool's own profiles**, recognised by exact namespace path under
`magicdraw.com`/`nomagic.com` — `/spec/Customization/…`, `/schemas/DSL_Customization.xmi`,
`/schemas/UI_Prototyping_Profile.xmi`, `/schemas/SimulationProfile.xmi` — configure the tool,
not the model. Their profiles are skipped, and so is the content they mark, with a reason naming
what it is: specification-dialog customization («Customization» classes and
«derivedPropertySpecification» properties, whose structured-expression bodies are not
translated), UI prototyping mockups, or simulation-tool configuration other than the
«SimulationConfig» run configurations, which [migrate](#run-configurations). A classifier
the tool also draws as a mockup but that is the model's — one with a standard stereotype, or
one that is active, names a classifier behavior or owns a behavior — migrates as such, its
tool marker an applied-stereotype comment. A host alone decides nothing: Cameo gives every locally defined profile a
`http://www.magicdraw.com/schemas/<Name>.xmi` namespace, so a profile there that is not one of
the known paths is a user profile.

**User profiles** — every other profile the document defines, on any host — are written as
packages of `metadata def`s, at the place the profile sits in the model, because that is what a
user stereotype is in v2. The package is written like any other: its enumerations become
`enum def`s and its comments `doc`s. Each stereotype becomes a `metadata def` whose tag
definitions are the stereotype's owned attributes: an `attribute` typed `ScalarValues::String`,
`Integer`, `Real` or `Boolean`, or by the `enum def` or `attribute def` the attribute's type
becomes; a `ref` when the type is a metaclass, a block or any other element, with the v1
multiplicity (`[0..*]`) and collection (`ordered`, `nonunique`). The `base_*` attributes and
`uml:Extension`s that bind the stereotype to the metaclass it extends are skipped with that
reason: v2 metadata applies to any element, and the migrated model applies it where v1 did.
The "profile or library content" skip covers the standard and tool profiles only; a user
profile is model content, so everything else in it — enumerations, value types, comments,
nested packages — migrates as it would anywhere in the model.

Generalization between stereotypes is followed, transitively, through every general, whether
the general is in the document, in the OMG XMI (`href="…/SysML.xmi#SysML.Requirement"`, with or
without MagicDraw's `referentPath`), in a Papyrus pathmap
(`pathmap://SysML_PROFILES/SysML.profile.uml#…`), or in a tool's bundled module. It decides
two things:

- **What an application means.** An application of a user stereotype applies every standard
  stereotype among the definition's generals too: a class stereotyped «Org Requirement» :>
  «Requirement» is a `requirement def`, its `Id`/`Text` (in either spelling) the short name and
  `doc`, exactly as a direct «Requirement» is; an `Abstraction` stereotyped «Checked By» :>
  «Verify» is a `verify`; a «Probability» descendant weights its edge. The user-added tags —
  those the standard general does not define — become the metadata usage `@Profile::'Org
  Requirement' { Rationale = "…"; }` in the same body, so nothing is written twice and nothing
  is lost. Diamonds and multiple generals all apply; a cycle is walked once. A same-named
  stereotype with no standard general («Requirement» in `Legacy`) means nothing standard: the
  class is a `part def` with a `@Legacy::Requirement { Text = "…"; }` usage.
- **What a metadata def specializes.** A user stereotype specializing another user stereotype
  in the document writes `metadata def B :> A`; one with no user general writes no `:>`, since
  every `metadata def` specializes `Metadata::MetadataItem` implicitly; a standard general is
  carried by the applications instead and adds nothing to the def; a general the document does not define
  (an `href` into a used project not in the archive, or an id the document lacks) is not
  written and the report says so; the edge closing a generalization cycle is not written
  either, since v2 forbids the cycle, and the report names it.

An application is written as metadata only when the document defines its stereotype: an
application from a profile that lives in a used project the archive does not bundle, or from an
unknown namespace, stays an applied-stereotype comment, and the report notes once per element
that the profile is outside the document. Tag values are written by the tag's type — a string,
integer, real or boolean literal, an enumeration literal by name, an element reference by the
shortest name resolving where the usage sits — and a value that does not fit (an unknown
literal, a reference to an element not written, a tag the stereotype does not define) is kept as
a comment inside the usage, approximating the element with the reason. Rich text a tool stores
as `<html><body>…</body></html>` becomes plain text, as a requirement's `Text` does.

One tool stereotype is read as a type, not kept as a comment: MagicDraw's «typeModifier» on a
property or parameter, whose tag spells a C-style shape after the type. `[]` on a feature
whose declared multiplicity is `[1]` or absent writes `[0..*] ordered nonunique`, and `[n]`
writes `[n] ordered nonunique`, so the feature is the sequence the tool meant; `*` (and `&`)
on a part or item property held by value writes it `ref`, a reference rather than a
containment. A shape with no v2 form is kept as the applied-stereotype comment with the reason
in the report: `[][]`, `[n*m]` and other two-dimensional shapes (a multiplicity has one
dimension), `[]` on a feature already declared a collection (a collection of collections has
no multiplicity) or whose declared bounds are not natural numbers, `*` on an attribute or on
a parameter (neither is held by reference), and a tag that is not one of these spellings. A
same-named user stereotype outside the MagicDraw profile namespace is a `metadata def` like
any other.

## Behaviors

A behavior is migrated so that it *runs*: the `action def` an activity becomes is a token flow
the [action executor](../guide/06-behavior.md) performs, and the `state def` a state machine
becomes is one the state debugger steps. Every generated model is gated to analyse clean, and
the migration tests execute a generated activity and a generated state machine, not only parse
them.

Every name the migration makes up because the source had none — an edge's spelling from its
ends, a node's kind made unique (`decide`, `fork2`, `final`), the `unnamed` and typed-after-type
refs, an anonymous end named for its type — is recorded in the body it is written in, once per
body, as `metadata MigrationMetadata::SynthesizedName about 'start to call', 'fork', final;`
(`$::MigrationMetadata::` where a member shadows the library). The names stay as written and
keyed by — an `expose`, a route, a qualified name all reach them — and what reads the model can
tell them from names the source gave: the [graphical renderings](../project/view-rendering-forms.md#node-labels)
draw such an element as its source did, unnamed — a bare control-node symbol, an edge with no
label — and every other name as it is. `MigrationMetadata` is a bundled OpenSysML library, not a
standard one; a v1 name is never marked, however it was spelled, and a model whose bodies hold
no made-up name gains no line.

**Activities.** The nodes are written first, then the edges. A node's name is its v1 name when
it has one, else its kind (`call`, `decide`, `fork`, …) made unique within the activity. A
call action is `action call : Def;`, so the callee's flow runs as a nested performance; its pins
are `bind`/`flow` statements from the object flows that reach them. A node several edges leave
without a fork is written through one (`fork fork2;`), and a node several edges reach without
a join waits through one, both reported as approximations. An opaque action whose body is a
script is read statement by statement through the [opaque-language subset](#the-opaque-language-subset):
`i = 1; GS_Found = false;` becomes two `assign` statements, `i += 1` an
`assign this.tcs.i := this.tcs.i + 1;`, and the body is kept as a comment naming its language
and the token refused when any statement is outside the subset or names something unwritten.

**Swimlanes.** An `ActivityPartition` that `represents` a property of the activity's context
block names the object whose features the nodes inside it read and write: a body `i = 1` in
the partition of the part `tcs` is `assign this.tcs.i := 1;`, and a guard `GS_Found` on an
edge whose source sits in that partition is `if this.tcs.GS_Found`. Names are looked up among
the node's own pins first — the tool binds a pin as a script variable, so a pin `Retries` on a
node in the partition is the value flowing into that node, not `this.tcs.Retries` — then in the
represented object, then among the activity's own parameters and locals, then in the owning
block; a nested partition reads through its enclosing ones (`this.tank.valve.open`), a
partition representing the context block itself reads `this`, and one representing a classifier,
or a property of one, that the context holds only through a chain of composite parts reads
through the whole chain, however long (`this.site.control.rack.controller.status`), when exactly
one such chain exists. A body's explicit `this` is the same object: the tool runs a node in a
partition in the represented object's context, so `this.status = true` there is the part's
`status`, and a feature the part lacks is refused (`Tank has no feature level`) rather than read
from the context block — a node that needs the block's own features sits outside the partition
or in one representing the block. A node in no partition, and a
partition whose `represents` is unset, names an id the document does not define, a property
with no v2 type, or a classifier the activity does not run in, fall back to the activity and
its block, and the partition's report line says which of these it is. A node held by two
partitions that do not nest — a diagram's two dimensions — resolves through the one that
represents an object when the other represents nothing, and through either when both represent
the same object; when they represent different objects, no partition applies, the node's names
fall back to the activity and its block, and both the node's and the partitions' report lines
say so. An edge in no partition takes its source node's partitions, its target's only when
the source is in none — so a guard leaving such a node is refused the same way, never read
through the target's partition. A name read through a part that holds more than one object —
a partition representing `cells : Gauge[2]`, or a dotted path `cells.reading` — is a
collection, so it feeds `java.util.Collections.max` but not arithmetic or a scalar assignment,
and an assignment through it (`cells.reading = 1`) is refused as writing several objects; a
`CallBehaviorAction` in such a partition runs in the caller's context, no one of the objects
performing it, and its report line says so. A part whose multiplicity is not written in numbers
(`banks : Bank[1..n]`) may hold one object or several, and the migrator cannot tell which: a
name read through it, a partition representing it, and a partition whose object is reached
through it are refused with the part named, never read as one object. The partition's comment
stays as documentation of its membership; its verdict is
*mapped* when a name was resolved through it.

**The clock.** The tool's time variable — `simtime`, or whatever the model's
`SimulationConfig.timeVariableName` names — reads the simulation clock, so a body reading it
is executable; the report line names the configuration that names it, or counts the
configurations when several do. The variable is the tool's global — every configuration's
name is recognized in every body, whichever activity the configuration targets — so a
parameter, pin or property of the same name visible where the body lands shadows it and is
read as that feature. `Time_Acq_Total = simtime;` is
`assign this.Time_Acq_Total := localClock.currentTime;`, and
`Time_Acq_Total = simtime - Time_Acq_Total;` the elapsed time since. `localClock.currentTime`
is the standard library's own form (`Occurrences::Occurrence::localClock`, a `Clock` whose
`currentTime` the [runtime](../guide/06-behavior.md#reading-the-clock) evaluates against the
run's clock), so a migrated model needs no extension library and the attribute is one a run
reports: `-observe this.Time_Acq_Total`, or `%runs` with the same. The clock is read, never
written: a script assigning `simtime` is refused. A `DurationObservation` whose two events are
nodes of the activity is the same bookkeeping written for the modeler: an `attribute` of the
`action def` named after the observation, stamped when the first node starts and assigned the
elapsed clock when the second ends (`firstEvent` chooses, per event, the instant the node's
execution enters it or the instant it exits, as UML defines; UML gives the omitted flag no
default, and the span then covers both nodes whole, from the first's start to the second's
end; a node executed again in a loop
stamps again, so the attribute holds the span between the latest executions of the two
nodes). An initial node is the point the activity's `start` reaches, so an observation
beginning there is stamped right after `start`, before the activity's own wait and its first
nodes, and spans the run when it ends at the final node; a flow final is the point a token
ends, so an observation ending there is stamped as the token reaches it, before `done` (the
edges into it lead to the stamp, through a `merge` when there are several); only an action has
an end of its own, so a flag asking for the end of an initial, final, flow final or control node
is refused with the node named. Both attributes are `[0..1]` with no default, and the elapsed
clock is assigned only when the stamp has happened, so a run that reaches neither node, or only
one, leaves the attribute without a value — a blank cell in the `-observe` table, outside the
summary — rather than a duration of zero; observations whose events are not nodes of the
activity, whose `event` list names an element the document does not define (the observation
is refused whole, never read as the one event that does resolve), and observations owned
outside any activity, are comments whose report line says which.

**The object an activity acts on.** A block's own activity acts on the block's object, `this`.
An activity no block owns, or one whose sends, accepts and calls all go through the ports of
another block, acts in v1 on whichever object ran it; it is written with a reference parameter
for that object, `in ref context : Host;`, its ports read `context.tx`, and every call of it
binds the parameter, `bind hit.context = this;` from that block's behaviors or `= context` from
another such activity. The block is the one whose ports the activity or the behaviors it calls
name; activities calling each other in a cycle name the ports of the whole cycle and take the
same block. An activity naming ports of several blocks none of which specializes the others
takes no parameter, and the report says which blocks; an activity naming none accepts through
the ports the signals it waits for arrive at, on the blocks whose behaviors run it.

An action whose input pin must hold a value (`lower` of 1 or more) but which only flows from
parameters nothing values, or from object flows that trace back to no pin or parameter at all (a
buffer nothing fills, an expansion node whose collection is not expanded), can never fire — the
token would wait forever at it — so it is written and reported as approximated with the pin that
starves it, no succession reaches or leaves it, and the report on the activity says
which of its parameters the caller has to value. A call whose target pin is fed from a part of
the context block, or from the activity's `context` parameter, performs the callee on that
object, `perform action x ::> drive.motor.spin;`.

**Values that never arrive.** v1 lets a call fire holding no value for a parameter that must
have one — the callee runs with the parameter empty — so the call is performed all the same,
and the parameter, and every pin and `out` parameter it feeds through any depth of nesting, is
declared admitting no value: its lower bound is written as zero, its upper bound kept, and the
report says on each why a value may fail to reach it (`declared admitting no value: …`). The
reasons are the ones the model itself decides: the call passes no argument for a required
parameter (one with no default and a lower bound above zero; `out` and `return` parameters and
the operation's target pin are not arguments), or the pin it passes is fed only by flows no value
travels — from a parameter nothing values, from an action that is not migrated (an opaque
action's result, or a value specification action whose literal is no value of its result's
type), from a call whose callee gives that `out` parameter no value, judged by the same analysis
of the callee's own activity, or from a call's result pin past the callee's `out` parameters,
which stands for none. Such a flow into a call is bound as any other; one from a source that
will hold nothing is kept as a comment naming it, never written as a `flow` from that feature.
A write of such a value to a feature requiring one is guarded, `if x->SequenceFunctions::notEmpty()
{ assign … }`, so the run neither invents a value nor fails the feature's multiplicity where v1
left it untouched. A signal send is the exception: v2 does not admit `send new Sig(x)` with a
required attribute unbound, so a send passing no argument, or a valueless pin, for a required
attribute of its signal, inherited ones included, keeps its place in the flow but performs
nothing, written as an empty action carrying the token, with the reason in its comment and in the
report. A call whose callee acts on an object the caller does not hold — the method reads
ports of its block, and the caller is a behavior of another block with no part of that type —
is refused the same way, since running it on the caller's object would go through ports it lacks.
A call behavior action that names no behavior yet has pins is written as a declared stub,
`action x { in a : T; out r : U[0..1]; }`: nothing in the model says what it performs, and no v1
relation it stands in names it — an «Allocate» from the action to a part says where it runs, not
what it does, and the report says so — so its pins are declared as its parameters, typed and
bounded as they are, no behavior or value is made up for it, and each output is declared admitting
no value, since nothing computes it. The flows into and out of it are written as for any action;
at run time a flow out of an unassigned output carries nothing, so its target reads the parameter
empty, and a required parameter it feeds is reported as holding no value rather than made up. A
call that does name a behavior keeps the parameters the behavior declares: a pin the behavior has
no parameter for is ill-formed v1, so the pin and its flows are dropped, the reason naming the
behavior and its parameters of that direction, while the call itself stays.

**Control nodes carrying data.** A fork, join, merge, decision or buffer node that lies on no
control path and whose every outgoing edge leads to an action's pin routes values, not control:
the flows through it are written from their sources to the pins it leads to, and the node
itself is reported as routing data only. A control node no edge leaves ends the token that reaches it, as
`done` does — through the stamp or wait a DurationObservation or DurationConstraint places on it, as a
flow final does — and one no edge reaches is skipped as a node nothing refers to. An action whose
input is fed by an object flow from an action outside its control path waits for the value as
well as for the control flow — a `join` of the two — but only when the producer runs on every
pass of the surrounding loop; a producer a later pass can skip, through a decision or a guarded
edge, is not waited on, since the wait would starve the consumer where v1 would go on with the
value the last pass left.

**Durations and probabilities.** A `DurationConstraint` on an action is a wait the action's
token takes before it: `accept after 3.0 [SI::s]` for a point interval, and
`accept after RandomFunctions::uniform(1.0, 80.0) [SI::s]` for a proper one — a draw from
the [model seed](../guide/06-behavior.md#seeds-where-the-draws-come-from). A simulation
tool's `min`/`max`/`average`/`random` duration mode belongs to its run configuration, not to
the model, so the interval is migrated faithfully as a random duration and the mode is the
[draw policy](../guide/06-behavior.md#draw-policies-min-max-average-and-random) of the run —
`-draws random -seed <n>` reproduces the tool's random mode, `-draws max` its max mode — which
each migrated configuration records (below). An interval open on one side — `{5s..}`, a max of
`*` — is satisfied by every wait past its bound, so no one delay stands for it and the
constraint is reported with the bound it lacks; the exception is a MagicDraw document, where a
constraint written with one value, `{60s}`, is stored as that min beside a max that is a
duration with no expression, and is written as the fixed wait it shows. «Probability» on the edges out of a decision is
written as `@Stochastic::Probability { p = … }` on each succession: a tag that is a number is
the constant `p = 0.5;`, and one that names a property of the activity or of the block whose
classifier behavior it is — the v1 idiom of an analysis block whose `ProbabilityBTOOP : Real`
each run configuration sets to `1.0` or `0.0` through its execution target's slots — is the
reference `p = ProbabilityBTOOP;`, which the run reads from the object performing the action
when the decision is reached, so the same behavior takes different odds on differently
configured objects. The property must be reachable from the action's execution context: a
numeric property holding one value, visible from the activity or inherited by its context
block; a tag naming anything else leaves the decision unweighted and the report says what it
names. An edge without a tag beside tagged ones takes its share of the remainder, `1.0 -
ProbabilityBTOOP` when the tagged one is a reference; constants that do not sum to 1 are scaled
by their sum, and a constant outside `[0, 1]` leaves the decision unweighted, each reported.
Guards that are opaque English (`[Align BTO]`) are kept as comments and the
edge written unguarded, so such a decision is a scheduling choice the runtime draws at random
with the model seed; the report says so. A guard in English that the subset reads — `TRUE`, a
Boolean property's name, `not Found and i < Retries` — is written as the `if` it means.

**State machines.** A composite state's regions become sub-states of a `parallel` state, so
the orthogonal regions run together — a region holding no vertex is skipped as content
nothing enters, so a machine whose one other region is populated is written inline and its
paths hold no parallel state; a submachine state is a `state` usage typed by the
referenced machine's `state def`, composing through any depth. Triggers are written on the
transition that refers to them — `accept Sig`, `accept after 2.0 [SI::s]`,
`accept when this.temperature > 200.0`, `accept at dawn` for an absolute time the `state def`
holds as a `Time::TimeInstantValue` attribute — and the event's own report line says where. An
event no trigger refers to is not a gap in the migration: nothing would ever accept it, so it
is skipped and the summary counts it apart from profile content. An effect with parameters
reads the accepted signal: the accept names it, `accept sig : Sig`, and the parameters the
signal fits are bound to that name. Entry, do and exit behaviors owned by the state are inline
action bodies, on a submachine state as on any other; those it only refers to are `entry x;`
references.

A state whose entry or do behavior takes parameters is entered by transitions that carry no
arguments, so the parameters are valued from the signal those transitions accept when every
transition into the state accepts the same signal and its attributes match the parameters in
order, type and multiplicity — the signal's own attributes first, then those it inherits from
its generals: the `state def` declares an item of the signal's type,
`item setPoint : SetPoint;`, each transition into the state assigns what it accepted to it,
`accept setPoint2 : SetPoint … assign setPoint := setPoint2;`, and the behavior's parameters
read its attributes, `in target : ScalarValues::Real = setPoint.level;` inline, or
`entry action : Handle { in level = setPoint.level; }` where the state refers to a behavior
written elsewhere, an `inout` parameter bound as `inout` so its value is written back. A state some
transition enters without a signal — from the initial pseudostate, on a time or change event,
or carrying a different signal — or whose parameters the signal's attributes do not fit, keeps
the parameters unvalued and the report says which transition or attribute is the reason; an
exit behavior with parameters is refused the same way, since nothing of the exit carries a
signal. A referred-to behavior whose parameter must hold a value is then not run, as a call
passing no argument for such a parameter is not.

A trigger naming a port of the behavior's owner is `accept Sig via rx`; one naming a port of
another block is written without it and the report says whose port it is. A trigger naming no
port is written plain, and it is also written accepting via each port of the owner the signal
arrives at, so a message a connector delivers to the port is taken as one addressed to the
object is. A signal arrives at a port when the document sends it through a port the connectors
and delegations join to it, when an item flow a connector realizes conveys it there, or when the
port's type — its generals and the interfaces it realizes included — declares a flow property of
the signal's type flowing in (out on a conjugated port) or a reception of the signal; a special
of a declared type arrives as well. A port that is untyped, or whose type declares neither flow
property nor reception, says nothing about what reaches it, so a signal nothing sends there is
not accepted via it and the report names the port left unrouted.

A transition whose ends lie in different regions or nesting levels names the far end by its
path — `transition first Idle accept Resume then Work::Run;` — which the runtime executes as
the compound transition v1 meant, exiting and entering the enclosing states along the way; a
local transition from a composite state into its own substate has no v2 form that stays inside
the state, so it is written external and reported as running the exit and entry behaviors. The
pseudostates are written as the v2 nodes of the same name: `junction`/`choice` for the guarded
chains, `fork`/`join` to enter and leave the regions of an orthogonal state, `history`/`deep
history` to re-enter what was active when the state was last left. An entry or exit point of a
state machine is a `state` of its `state def` whose own transition continues into the machine,
and a submachine state's connection point references address them by path,
`then Cell::warmStart;` / `first Cell::spent then Idle;`. An entry or exit point of a composite
state (UML `State.connectionPoint`) is a `junction` of that state — its transient node, so a
transition in from outside, `then Work::start;`, runs the state's entry behavior, then the
junction's own transition and the target's entries in the same step, and a transition out,
`first Work::leave then Idle;`, runs the inner transition's exits and effect, the state's exit
behavior, then the outgoing effect and the target's entry — the order UML 2.5.1 §14.2.3.4.5 and
PSSM give connection points. An entry point whose transitions each start a region of an
orthogonal state is a `fork`, an exit point its regions reach from each side a `join`; an entry
point no transition leaves is the state's default entry, and the transition is written to the
state. An entry point that leads straight to an exit point of the same state, so the state is
crossed without settling in it, is refused: the runtime would run neither its entry nor its exit
behavior; so is an entry point whose transition leads back to the state itself (v1 enters it by
its default entry where the runtime would leave and re-enter it), out of the state, on into a
history pseudostate or to no target, one whose transition has a trigger (a junction's transition
is followed at once, not on an event), and any point whose transitions do not form one of the
shapes above. An exit point's outgoing transition is held to the same: one with a trigger, to
no target, into a history, back to the state or to a vertex within it refuses the point, as does
an exit point no transition leaves, since the runtime would halt at the junction. A guard on that transition is kept: UML evaluates a junction's guards with the
rest of the compound transition's before it fires, not after entering the state, and the
runtime evaluates the junction's guard when it selects the transition; where UML leaves the
compound transition disabled by a false guard, the runtime reports it, as at any junction.
A connection point a tool lists among a region's vertices rather than as the state's
`connectionPoint` is still the state's, and is named through the state, not the region. An
internal transition is a self transition, faithful when re-entering the state is not observable (no entry, exit, do or
substates) and reported otherwise; one written with no target stays in its source, one that
targets another vertex or leaves a pseudostate is refused, and one without a trigger is a
comment, as a self transition would fire again on every re-entry. A transition into an exit point of a
region, or a terminate pseudostate, is written to `done`.

**Interactions.** An interaction owned by a block is a scenario: an `action def` of the block
whose steps are the messages in the order their occurrences take on the lifelines. Each
lifeline is resolved to a feature path from the block through its parts, ports and references
and their types — `drive.motor` — or to an `in` parameter of the interaction (two parts of one
type are two paths, `left.motor` and `right.motor`, so a lifeline standing for their shared
`motor` is ambiguous), and a lifeline that resolves to nothing, to two paths, to an `out`
parameter or through a `selector` refuses the whole interaction, since the scenario could not
address its steps. A signal message is
`send new Sig(n = 3) to this.drive.motor;`; a call message is a typed perform of the
operation's usage on the object, `perform action spin : Motor::Spin ::> drive.motor.spin
{ in rpm = 30.0; }`, its arguments bound to the operation's `in` and `inout` parameters by
name or by position, each with the parameter's direction so an `inout` value is written back
to what the argument named, and a call that leaves a required parameter (no default, lower bound above zero)
unbound refuses the interaction; a reply answers the latest call of its operation between
its lifelines that no earlier reply has answered, so nested calls pair with their replies
stack-like, and assigns that call's `out` to the attribute of the caller's lifeline the reply
names when the reply lies in the call's fragment or one nested in it. The operands of an `alt`,
`opt` or `loop` are alternative paths, so each may answer a call made before the fragment, and a
call answered on any of those paths (or made on only some of them) is open to no reply after the
fragment; the operands of a `par` are unordered between themselves, so none answers a call
another makes, while the calls they make are open after the join. Combined fragments become the
corresponding action structure when their guards are v2
expressions whose names resolve — `if`/`else` for `alt` and `opt`, `for`/`while` for `loop`,
`fork`/`join` for `par` — and refuse the interaction, quoting the guard, when they are not.
A duration constraint on a message is a wait before its step, as on an action; one between
two messages measures the interval from the earlier step to the later one, so it is a wait
before the later step when nothing lies between them and otherwise a wait forked after the
earlier step and joined before the later — the steps between count toward the interval, and
the bound is drawn once at the earlier step. Two steps in different fragments cannot share a
fork and join, so such a constraint is reported instead.
Create and delete messages are comments where the step would go, since a part exists for as
long as its owner does; the steps around them are written. An interaction with no message is
not a scenario: the report names what it records (state invariants under time constraints are
a timing trace). An interaction that is a `TestCase` is a `verification def` whose subject is
the block, the steps addressing the parts through it.

**Receptions.** A block's reception is an `action def` of the block that accepts its signal,
`action receive accept setLevel : Signals::SetLevel;`, and runs the method as a nested typed
action whose `in` parameters read the accepted signal's attributes of the same name,
`action run : 'Apply Level' { in value = setLevel.value; }`, then returns to the accept,
`first run then receive;`; a method that is also the method of an operation of the block is
written once, as that operation's body, so the reception runs the operation's `action def`,
binding the parameters it declares. The block performs it, `perform action setLevel : SetLevel;`, so
every object of the block listens from the moment it is created — nothing starts the reception —
and a signal sent to the object at any time is accepted and its method runs against the object,
not the signal, as many times as the signal arrives. The runtime keeps a message delivered to a
port apart from one addressed to the object, so where the document's connectors or port
declarations bring the signal to ports of the block, the accept is forked: after `start` a
`fork spread;` leads to the accept from the object and to one accept per port,
`action 'receive via rx' accept 'setLevel via rx' : Signals::SetLevel via rx;`, each running the
method and returning to its own accept, so a signal sent to the object or through any of those
ports runs the method; a port nothing declares or sends the signal to is named in the report as
not accepting it, as for a trigger. A reception without a method, or with one
that is not an Activity, accepts the signal and listens again, and the report names the method
it does not run; so does one whose method has an `in` parameter with no default and a lower bound
above zero that no attribute of the signal supplies, since v2 does not run an action holding no
value for it, and one whose same-named attribute is typed by a type that does not conform to the
parameter's (a `String` attribute for an `Integer` parameter) or whose multiplicity does not lie
within the parameter's (`[0..*]` for `[1]`), since binding it would violate the parameter.

**Operation calls over ports.** A `CallOperationAction` with `onPort` is resolved the way the
connector paths are: a connector of the caller's block from that port to a port of a part
whose type owns the operation makes the call a perform of the part's usage,
`perform action 'spin over p' ::> motor.spin;`; a port of the target itself names the target;
a port no connector joins, or one whose connectors reach several parts that own the operation
(the call names no one of them), leaves the call an action typed by the operation, running in
the caller's context, and the report says so.

**Running a migrated behavior.** Instantiate the block whose classifier behavior the activity
or state machine is, then step it or run it many times with the model seed:

```text
%runs 100 1 Model::'Mission'::'Acquire Target'::'Acquire Target - Logical'
%instantiate Model::APS::'Acquisition Pointing and Tracking Assembly'
%state Model::APS::'Acquisition Pointing and Tracking Assembly'::CC_APT
%send Model::APS::Signals::'Select APT Filter_Cmd'
%step
```

`%runs` reports the clock at the end of each run — the workflow's total duration — as min,
mean, max, p50 and p90 with a histogram, and `sysml model.sysml -action <name> -runs 100 -seed 1`
does the same from the command line. An attribute the migrated body assigns from the clock is
observed beside it with `-observe this.Time_Acq_Total`; an action that reads its performer's
features (the `this.tcs.i` of a swimlane) is run through the performer, `-action "'Block' 'Action'"`.

### Calls to the fUML and Alf libraries

A `CallBehaviorAction` whose behavior is an element of the
fUML library document (`http://www.omg.org/spec/FUML/<date>/fUML_Library.xmi`) or the Alf
library document (`http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/<date>/Alf-Library.xmi`) calls a primitive the
tool computes, not an activity the model holds. The migrator knows the behavior by the document
the href names and the fragment within it — whatever date the URI carries, and whether or not
the model bundles a copy of the library, whose copy is then read for the pins' types but never
for the mapping — never by the behavior's bare name, so a model's own `Concat` is an ordinary
call. A tool that ships the library as a module of its own rather than pointing at the OMG
document — MagicDraw and Cameo reference the used project `fUML-Library.mdzip`, by an href such
as `fUML-Library.mdzip#_jJIy63OeEd2TgN94jve35g` with the element's qualified name recorded
beside it as a `referentPath` — is known the same way, by the library's identity: the href must
name the library's own document (`fUML-Library` or `fUML_Library`, `Alf-Library`, whatever its
model extension or the path to it), and the behavior it resolves to — the bundled copy when the
module's contents are in the archive, else the `referentPath` — must sit under the library's
own root package (`fUML_Library` or `FoundationalModelLibrary`; `Alf::Library`), family and
name: `fUML_Library::PrimitiveBehaviors::ListFunctions::ListSize`. Both are required, so a
package of the model's own that happens to be named `fUML_Library`, referenced within the
document or by an href into another module, is the model's, and its `ListSize` an ordinary
call. The report says which provenance identified each call: the OMG href, the bundled copy the
href resolves to, or the `referentPath` recorded beside the href into the library module. The
boundary is the module's name: a module file literally named `fUML-Library` or `Alf-Library`
is trusted as the library, whatever project it came from, since the migrator reads neither the
used-project URI nor the module's read-only marker.
The call is written with its pins, and each result pin takes the v2 library expression
over the argument pins, so the flows out of it carry the computed value:
`out result : ScalarValues::String = StringFunctions::'+'(x, y);`. The pins bind to the
primitive's parameters by position, as v1 orders them, and their types and multiplicities are
not checked against the primitive's signature — v1 requires a pin to conform to its parameter,
so a call whose pins do not is ill-formed, and is written as it stands. A sequence parameter may be
passed nothing — the empty sequence — but a scalar parameter must hold a value: a call that
passes no argument for one, or whose pin only flows from something that produces none, never
fires in v1, and is written as an empty action carrying the token, as any starved call is.
So is a call whose value pin holds a value v2 cannot spell — an unlimited natural `*`, a real
that is not a finite number — since v1 computes on a value the written call would lack; the note
says which value and why.
Where the v2 function differs from the v1 behavior — an index outside the sequence fails in v2
where v1 gives no result; `ToBoolean` reads `TRUE` in v1 and only `true` in v2 — the call is
approximated and the note says how; where the v2 library has no equivalent, the call is
refused with the reason, and its result flows are comments. The table holds every behavior of
both library documents, and `ListConcat`, which fUML 1.5 Table 9.7 lists but the 2018
`fUML_Library.xmi` omits. The mapping, as the tests pin it:

## The opaque-language subset

A v1 body carries a `language` and a text the tool executed — JavaScript, in Cameo's case, or
"English" for guards written as prose. The migrator translates a bounded subset of each into
v2 expressions and statements, and refuses the rest with a typed reason naming the token, so a
translation is always complete or absent — never partial.

**Scripts** (`language` JavaScript, ECMAScript, Java, or none) are read as statements. A
JavaScript label is `JavaScript`, `ECMAScript` or `JS`, or its engine (`Rhino`, `Nashorn`), in
any combination with at most one version (`Javascript Rhino`, `JavaScript (Nashorn)`,
`ECMAScript 2015`, `JavaScript 1.8 Rhino`); a Java label is `Java` alone or followed by one
version (`Java 8`, `Java 1.8.0_202`, `Java 17.0.2+8`). Any other word makes the label a
language the translator does not read: `JavaCC`, `Java Expression Language`, `JavaScript
Expression Language`, `ECMAScript for XML`, `JSON`:

| Script | v2 |
|---|---|
| `x = e;` `x += e;` `-=` `*=` `/=` `x++` `x--` | `assign x := e;` `assign x := x + e;` … |
| `var x = e;` `let x = e;` `const x = e;` (one name, initialized) | `attribute x : ScalarValues::T;` `assign x := e;` with `T` the type of `e`; a later assignment to a `const` is refused, as is a declaration of a name already declared, of a pin, parameter or property visible where the body lands, or of a member every action has (`start`, `done`, `self`) |
| several statements, on `;` or newlines | a sequence of the above |
| integer, real, Boolean and string literals | the same literal; a whole number is refused beyond what an `Integer` holds (2⁶³ − 1), and in a JavaScript body beyond 2⁵³ − 1, since the script would round it to a `Number` (a Java body's `long` is exact); a string's `\n` `\t` `\r` `\b` `\f` `\\` `\'` `\"` `\xHH` `\uHHHH` `\u{H…}` escapes and line continuations are decoded, a high and low surrogate escape pair as the one character they spell, while a legacy octal escape or a character the notation cannot spell (`\0`, `\v`, other control characters, a lone surrogate) is refused |
| `a`, `a.b.c` naming features that resolve | `this.a`, `this.a.b.c` (through the swimlane's object when it has one) |
| `+ - * / %`, comparisons, `&& \|\| !`, parentheses | `+ - * / %`, comparisons, `and or not`, parentheses; a Java body's `/` of two whole numbers drops the remainder, so it is `OpenSysMLMathFunctions::quotient(x, y)` (the exact Integer quotient truncated toward zero, refused at run time only for the least Integer by `-1`, whose quotient no Integer holds), and is refused when the operands' types cannot tell whether both are whole. Whole-number arithmetic is the exact arithmetic of a v2 `Integer`: a script that rounds a result beyond 2⁵³ to a `Number`, or a Java `int`/`long` that wraps past its range, computes something else there, which the translation does not reproduce — the translated feature holds the modeler's `Integer`, not a floating-point or fixed-width number |
| Java's `a.equals(b)` / `"x".equals(b)` on strings | `a == b`, the comparison of their content; a Java body's `==` or `!=` with an operand known to be a string is refused, since Java compares strings there by identity, which no comparison of their values reproduces, and `equals` is translated only on a receiver known to be a string — a string literal, or a feature or local declared `String` — since any other type's `equals` is that type's own method, and is refused where the argument is known not to be a string (a script's `==` on strings compares their content and translates as it stands) |
| `c ? a : b` | `if c ? a else b` when `a` and `b` are of one scalar type |
| `Math.min` `Math.max` `Math.abs` `Math.floor` `Math.ceil` `Math.round` `Math.sqrt` `Math.pow`, `a ** b` | `RealFunctions::min` … `RealFunctions::sqrt`, `**`; `Math.min` and `Math.max` take any number of arguments in a script, folded pairwise (`max(max(a, b), c)`; one argument is that argument, none is refused as the infinity the script answers), and exactly two in a Java body, as Java's do; `Math.ceil(x)` is `OpenSysMLMathFunctions::ceiling(x)` (the extension library's `Integer` ceiling, so the least Integer is a value where `-floor(-x)` would overflow on its negation) and `Math.round(x)` is `RealFunctions::floor(x + 0.5)`, which rounds a half toward +∞ as JavaScript does. The three answer the library's `Integer` in a script, and in a Java body `Math.round` does where `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` answer a `Real` as Java's answer a `double` (so a Java `/` after them is real division, not `quotient`); each result is exact up to the `Integer` range and a whole Real at or beyond 2⁶³ (or below −2⁶³), which the script would keep as a `Number` and Java's `Math.round` would clamp to a `long`, is a typed arithmetic-overflow error at run time, never a wrapped Integer; `-a ** b` is refused, as JavaScript rejects a unary operand of `**` without parentheses, and a Java body's `**` is refused, Java having no such operator |
| `java.util.Collections.max(s)` / `.min(s)` | `RealFunctions::max(s)` / `RealFunctions::min(s)` over a collection |
| the tool's time variable (`simtime`) | `localClock.currentTime` |
| `print(…);` `println(…);` `System.out.print(…);` `System.out.println(…);` (also qualified `java.lang.System.out.…`) as a statement | nothing: the call writes to the tool's console and changes no value of the model, so it is left out of the translation, the other statements of the body stand, and the report notes each print left out as an approximation; a body of prints alone is an empty action. The arguments are read for what they could change: one that assigns (`print(i = 1)`), counts (`i++`), deletes (`delete x`), constructs (`new Date`) or calls anything but a function of this table computing a value (`Math.max`, `Collections.max`, a Java `equals` on a receiver known to be a string — one on any other receiver may be that type's own method) could change the model, so that print is refused rather than left out; a print used as a value (`i = print(x)`) is a call outside the table |

**English** (`language` English, natural language, text) is read as one Boolean expression:
`TRUE` / `FALSE` / `true` / `false`; a property name, spaces and all; `not X`; `X and Y`;
`X or Y`; comparisons written with `=` or `==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`; parentheses. A run
of words between operators is one name (`not Guide Star Lost and i < Retries` reads the
property `Guide Star Lost`), refused whole when nothing visible is called that. English has no
calls: `Math.sqrt(t) > 3` or `name.equals(other)` in an English body is refused as a construct
outside the subset, never run as the script functions of the same name.

**Refusals.** Anything else is refused, and the report line carries the reason with the token
that caused it: a language not in the table (`the language "Groovy" is not translated`), text
that is not expression syntax, a construct outside the subset (`for`, `while`, `if` statements,
`new`, `function`, a declaration of several names or of a name a feature already has, an
assignment to a `const`, to an `in` parameter or to an input pin, a string method, a regular expression, an expression that assigns nothing, text
after the one expression a guard or default is), a call not in the table (`the call "log" is not in the
translated function table`), a name that resolves to nothing readable (`this.` in a context with
no object, a property of no v2 type, a name no scope defines), or types that disagree (an
`Integer` guard, a `Boolean` added to a `Real`, a plural where a scalar is wanted, a feature
typed by an enumeration or a block where a number or Boolean is wanted, assigned to a feature
of a type that neither is nor generalizes its own, or compared with or chosen beside one sharing
no type with it). A feature whose type the migrator does not know is trusted to fit. A body
whose language the translator reads but whose text it refuses — as not that language's syntax
any more than as a construct, call, name or type it rejects — is never re-read as v2 syntax:
the refusal is final, and the body is a comment. A body in a language the translator does not
read, or in none, is read as v2 syntax.

A translation is emitted only when every name resolves to a written feature visible where the
statement lands, the types agree wherever they can be told (a guard is `Boolean`, an
assignment fits its target, a property's or parameter's default, the value of a typed pin or result, or the result
expression of a `calc def` is of the feature's or the return parameter's type — its scalar, or a
block or enumeration it is or specializes — and one value unless the feature holds several, a
duration is `Real`), and the result parses with the v2 parser.

## Run configurations

A simulation tool's run configuration — MagicDraw's «SimulationConfig», recognised by the
provenance of its profile (`magicdraw.com` or `nomagic.com`, at `/schemas/SimulationProfile.xmi` and no
other path; a stereotype so named from any other profile is kept as a comment), not by its name — states which
object a behavior ran on, how many times, and how the tool resolved its random durations. Each
becomes an `action def` a user runs as any other:

```sysml
action def 'Group 0' {
    @Simulation::Configuration {
        runs = 1000;
        draws = Simulation::DrawPolicy::random;
        timeVariable = "simtime";
        startTime = 0.0;
        stepSize = 0.01;
        timeUnit = "second";
        parallelForks = true;
    }
    part target : Analysis::'Analysis Group 0';
    perform action run ::> target.'acquire Target - Logical';
    /* results of the simulation tool: 13 snapshot(s) in Analysis::Results::'Group 0' holding ProbabilityBTOOP, Time_Acq_Total, … */
    /* «SimulationConfig» settings of the simulation tool: animationSpeed = 97; silent = true; … */
}
```

- The `executionTarget` is the `target` part, typed by the individual the target instance
  became — so its slots, the configuration's property values, are the attributes the run reads,
  its «Probability» references included — and the classifier behavior of the target's
  classifier (the nearest written one, up the generalizations) is performed on it by `run`. A
  target that is absent, several, outside the document, not migrated, or written as a
  definition no part can be typed by (a port def, an attribute def), a classifier with no
  classifier behavior, and a classifier behavior that is a state machine each leave the
  configuration performing nothing, with the reason in the report and the `action def` still
  written, holding its metadata and whatever part it could.
- `numberOfRuns` and `durationSimulationMode` are the `runs` and `draws` of
  [`Simulation::Configuration`](../guide/06-behavior.md#draw-policies-min-max-average-and-random):
  the count to pass as `-runs` and the policy to pass as `-draws`, which OpenSysML's runs do not
  read from the model but the harness below applies. `timeVariableName`, `startTime`, `stepSize`,
  `timeUnit` and `runForksInParallel` are recorded as `timeVariable`, `startTime`, `stepSize`,
  `timeUnit` and `parallelForks`: they describe the clock the tool ran on, and OpenSysML's clock
  is the run's own, so a run reads none of them. One of them the harness does apply: a
  configuration stating `startTime` ran on the tool's internal clock, which ticks by `stepSize`
  (`(endTime − startTime) / numberOfSteps` when those two are stated instead, else `1.0`) in
  `timeUnit` and notices a wait's end at the tick after it, so the sidecar
  records that step in seconds as `clockStep` and `-compare-results` runs the configuration on a
  clock stepping by it (`-clock-step` overrides it). A `timeUnit` the migration cannot read as a
  fixed number of seconds, a `stepSize` of zero or less, or one that in its unit is more seconds
  than a number holds or fewer than it tells from none, leaves the step out with a note and
  the runs on a continuous clock; an unstated `timeUnit` is the tool's default, the millisecond,
  as a bare duration of the model is read, and the reading is noted. The tool's clock started at
  `startTime`; a run's starts at 0, so a `startTime` other than 0 is noted as an approximation —
  an instant read on the clock, by an `at` trigger or the clock variable, is offset by that start
  in a run — and the note reaches the sidecar and the comparison. A
  configuration without `startTime` ran on the tool's real-time clock and records no step. A mode
  that is none of the four policies,
  and a run count beyond what a Monte Carlo can make (a 64-bit count), are kept among the
  tool's other tags in the trailing comment, as are `animationSpeed`,
  `silent` and every setting with no v2 meaning; `autostartActiveObjects` and
  `treatAllClassifiersAsActive` set to true state what every v2 object does anyway, so they are
  consumed, and set to false they are kept in the comment and reported as having no v2 form.
- The tool's own results — the snapshots it stored of the configuration's runs under its
  `resultLocation` packages, one instance per run whose slots hold the observed values, most
  naming no classifier — are migrated as individuals of the most special block their slots'
  features belong to, provided those blocks are one lineage ending in the configuration's target
  classifier or a general of it (a classifier-less instance anywhere else, or whose slots are of
  unrelated blocks, is unmapped with the reason), and indexed per configuration — a snapshot
  classified by the target's classifier, a general or a special of it, not one classified by a
  sibling special sharing only a general with it, which is of a run on another kind — in the JSON sidecar
  `-convert sysml … -migration-results results.json` writes beside the notation:

  ```json
  {"source": "model.xmi", "configurations": [
    {"id": "_g0", "name": "Group 0", "runs": 1000, "draws": "random", "clockStep": 1.0,
     "target": "target", "behavior": "run", "resultLocation": "Analysis::Results::Group 0",
     "observables": ["Time_Acq_Total", "Time_Dither"],
     "snapshots": [{"id": "_s1", "name": "Acq 1", "values": {"Time_Acq_Total": 80.228, "Time_Dither": 0.0}}],
     "notes": ["the slot of Verdict holds a LiteralBoolean, which is no number in 13 snapshot(s), so it is not among the results"]}]}
  ```

  A JSON sidecar rather than a v2 result table, because the snapshots are the tool's
  measurements of the *tool's* run, not facts of the model: the notation carries them as
  individuals a reader can inspect, and the sidecar carries them in the form the comparison
  reads without re-parsing the model. A snapshot records the state of the object the run was
  made on, its configured features included, so one whose slots record other values of the
  features the target's own slots set — several configurations often share one result
  package — is of another configuration and left out with a note counting it. A configured
  value tells snapshots apart whatever its kind — a number, a Boolean, a string or an
  enumeration literal — though only the numbers are results; a number is compared exactly,
  however its literal spells it (`1` is `1.0`); a literal left blank configures nothing.
  Locations that
  repeat or nest (a package and a sub-package of it) index each snapshot once. A
  `resultLocation` outside the document, a snapshot slot with no defining feature in the
  document or holding no one finite number, a number the sidecar's float64 cannot spell
  exactly (an integer beyond 2^53, a decimal of more digits than a float64 keeps; the
  statistics are float64s, so it is noted rather than rounded), a feature two slots of one
  snapshot hold numbers
  for (left out of that snapshot whether or not a float64 spells each: it has no one result
  there, so it also records no other value than the target configures and does not put the
  snapshot out), and a target with no
  classifier to match snapshots against are each noted in the configuration's `notes`.
- A target whose classifier specializes MagicDraw's `MonteCarloAnalysis` (the analysis pattern
  of the SysML customization module, recognised by the module's provenance) summarises its runs
  rather than recording
  each: a snapshot's `N`, `Mean`, `Deviation` and `OutOfSpec` slots are the count, mean,
  standard deviation and out-of-specification count of the observable the analysis binds its
  `Mean` to, so they are kept out of the observables and written as the snapshot's
  `"statistics"` (`runs`, `mean`, and `deviation` and `outOfSpec` only when the snapshot
  records them — a summary without a `Deviation` states none rather than a zero), standing for
  `N` runs, and the configuration's `"analysis"` names that observable, which the snapshot
  holds the same mean for; `"analysisCase"` names the `analysis def` written for the target
  (see [Monte Carlo analyses](#monte-carlo-analyses)) and `"statistics"` on the configuration
  lists the statistics it returns, in order, as the tool names them (`["Mean", "Deviation"]`). An analysis binding its `Mean` to no feature, or to several, a
  snapshot recording `N` without `Mean` or the reverse, an `N` that is no count, a negative
  `Deviation`, an `OutOfSpec` that is no count of the `N` runs, a statistic that is no one number
  (a string, `NaN`, two values in one slot, one statistic over two slots; a blank literal is the
  tool's zero), or a `Mean` no
  value of the observable holds is noted and the snapshot read as an ordinary run of the
  numbers it does hold; one whose `Mean` another feature holds instead summarises an analysis
  of another configuration and is set aside with a note.
- A target whose classifiers, and their generals, have no classifier behavior but hold
  constraint properties — the parametric configurations a tool solves for values — performs
  nothing, since a v2 run checks a constraint and does not solve it; the note lists each
  constraint property the target holds, through its parts, with its constraint block and whether
  the block's rule is migrated as a constraint or, for an opaque rule the translated function
  table lacks, which call stops it.

`sysml model.sysml -compare-results results.json` then runs every configuration the sidecar
indexes — with its `runs`, `draws` and `clockStep`, or the `-runs`, `-draws` and `-clock-step` given, seeded from `-seed` —
and prints, per observable, the tool's and OpenSysML's min, mean, p50, p90 and max with their
relative difference; see
[Comparing a migrated configuration with the tool's results](cli.md#comparing-a-migrated-configuration-with-the-tools-results).
A stored observable is read off the target by default (`Time_Acq_Total` beside
`target.Time_Acq_Total`), or off the feature `-observe Time_Acq_Total=clock` names, so a total
the tool read from its time variable is set beside the run's clock. The observable a Monte
Carlo analysis summarises is compared statistic by statistic, one row per `return` the
analysis def declares and one per output of `Simulation::MonteCarlo` the tool stored without
a return: the tool's `Mean` and `Deviation`, pooled over its summaries, against the
runs' by the same aggregation (the arithmetic mean and the sample standard deviation), `N`
side by side, and `OutOfSpec` shown but not compared, being the tool's own criterion. An observable the completed
runs produce in more than one unit (a quantity in some, a bare number or another unit in others)
has no one distribution to set beside the tool's and is noted, not pooled; so is one some completed
runs produce as no number, with the count of those runs. The numbers are printed
as they are: a difference is a fact about the migration's fidelity, to be read against the
report's approximations, not tuned away.

### Monte Carlo analyses

MagicDraw's SysML customization module ships an analysis pattern the Simulation Toolkit
fills: a user block generalizes its `MonteCarloAnalysis`, owns the value it analyses, and a
«BindingConnector» binds that value to the pattern's `Mean` (or `Deviation`, `N`,
`OutOfSpec`); after `N` runs the tool writes the four statistics into the result instance. The
pattern is recognised by the module's provenance alone — the generalization's `general` is the
module's `MonteCarloAnalysis` — so a user's own block named `MonteCarloAnalysis` is an ordinary
block, and so is everything generalizing or binding to it.

The block is written as its `part def` (the pattern's generalization left out, the report saying
so) and, beside it, an `analysis def` specializing `Simulation::MonteCarlo`, the OpenSysML
library's analysis of repeated runs, whose `subject` is the part def, whose one run performs the
block's classifier behavior, whose `observed` is the value bound to `Mean`, and whose returns
are the statistics the block's connectors bind:

```sysml
part def 'Timer Analysis' :> Timer { attribute t : Real; }
analysis def 'Timer Analysis Monte Carlo' :> Simulation::MonteCarlo {
    subject analysed : 'Timer Analysis';
    perform action run ::> analysed.tick;
    attribute :>> observed : Real = analysed.t;
    return Mean : Real = mean;
    out Deviation : Real[0..1] = deviation;
}
```

`Mean` and `Deviation` are returned as `Real`, `N` and `OutOfSpec` as the scalar of the value
bound to them, and a note says when that is not the value's own type (a value type over
`Integer`, say); a binding of a value of no numeric type, of a statistic the pattern
is not known to have, a second binding of one statistic, or a binding to a statistic other
than `Mean` with nothing bound to `Mean` (a statistic of nothing) is a comment naming the
reason. A block specializing such a block has an analysis def of its own when it binds a
statistic itself, returning what its own connectors bind and then what it inherits and does not
rebind (a general's `Deviation` beside its own `N`, say). A snapshot's four statistic slots
become a recorded `analysis` of that def in the snapshot's individual, with the snapshot as its
subject and the statistics as its outputs.

`sysml out.sysml -analysis "'Timer Analysis Monte Carlo' <object>" -runs 100 -seed 7` then
runs the case: each run on a fresh subject seeded from the seed and the run number, its
observation tabled, and the case concluded once over the sample — `runs`, `mean`,
`deviation` (the sample standard deviation, none under two runs) and `outOfSpec` (the runs in
which a check of the case did not hold) bound and the declared returns evaluated over them; see
[Running an action many times](cli.md#running-an-action-many-times). Run once, without
`-runs`, the statistics stay unbound: an analysis of one run is not passed off as one of many.

## The report

Nothing is dropped silently. Every element the reader saw is in the report exactly once with
one of four verdicts:

- **mapped** — a faithful v2 form.
- **approximated** — written, but not one-to-one; the note says what was lost or changed.
- **unmapped** — no v2 form was written. The element appears in the notation as a comment at
  the place it would have gone, so a reader of the migrated model can see the gap.
- **skipped** — the standard profiles and libraries, the modeling tool's own profiles and the
  content they mark (specification-dialog customization, UI mockups, simulation-tool
  configuration; the reason names which), and the user's own elements nothing in the model
  refers to (an event no trigger names), which no v2 form would represent; the summary counts
  the profile and library content apart from the unreferenced elements. A user's profile is
  not skipped: its stereotypes are mapped to `metadata def`s.

The text form (default) groups by verdict, unmapped first, one line per element: kind with its
stereotypes, qualified v1 name, `xmi:id`, the v2 name it became, and a note. The JSON form
(`-migration-report x.json`) is the same content as `{source, exporter, entries: [{id, kind,
name, target, verdict, note}]}` for tooling. Without `-migration-report`, the one-line summary
goes to stderr. `-migration-results x.json` writes beside it the
[result snapshots](#run-configurations) of every run configuration, and reports what it wrote
in one line: `results of 3 run configuration(s): 2 with 15 stored snapshot(s)`.

## Guarantees

Every migrated model is gated in the test suite to:

1. parse and analyse clean under the v2 semantic passes (`go test ./internal/translate/migrate`),
2. round-trip through Turtle (notation → `.ttl` → notation → `.ttl`) without changing its graph,
3. account for every element in the report, and leave a comment for every unmapped one.

A model the reader cannot make sense of — not XMI, a zipped project container, a document
without a model — is refused with an error naming the reason rather than migrated partially.

### Portable output with `-strict`

A migration under `-strict` writes only notation a pinned SysML v2 production admits, so the
output analyses clean under [strict conformance](../guide/03-command-line.md#strict-conformance)
and carries nothing an interchange partner could not read: a construct whose only v2 form is an
OpenSysML extension — a `deferrableTrigger` (`defer <event>;`), a `choice`, `junction`,
`shallowHistory` or `deepHistory` pseudostate, or an entry or exit point of a composite state
that would be written as a junction — is refused and reported **unmapped** with the note
`… is an OpenSysML extension with no SysML v2 production, which a strict migration does not
write`, and a transition to or from it is refused rather than written to an undeclared name.
The standard forms stay: `fork`, `join`, an entry point's default entry and a machine's
connection points are written as before. The default migration is unchanged — it writes the
extension notation, which the runtime executes and the validator reports as a warning.
